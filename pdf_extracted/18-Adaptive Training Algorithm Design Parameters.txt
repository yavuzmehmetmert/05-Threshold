Introduction:
 
The
 
Cybernetic
 
Loop
 
of
 
Athletic
 
Performance
 
The
 
paradigm
 
of
 
athletic
 
training
 
is
 
undergoing
 
a
 
fundamental
 
transformation,
 
shifting
 
from
 
static,
 
linear
 
periodization
 
models—often
 
delivered
 
via
 
immutable
 
spreadsheets
 
or
 
PDFs—to
 
dynamic,
 
computational
 
ecosystems
 
known
 
as
 
Adaptive
 
Training
 
Algorithms
 
(ATAs).
 
These
 
systems
 
promise
 
a
 
"coach-in-the-pocket"
 
experience,
 
utilizing
 
machine
 
learning
 
and
 
heuristic
 
logic
 
to
 
tailor
 
training
 
loads
 
to
 
the
 
individual’s
 
evolving
 
physiology.
 
However,
 
the
 
efficacy
 
of
 
an
 
ATA
 
is
 
not
 
defined
 
solely
 
by
 
the
 
sophistication
 
of
 
its
 
internal
 
biological
 
model
 
or
 
the
 
granularity
 
of
 
the
 
objective
 
data
 
(power,
 
heart
 
rate,
 
pace)
 
it
 
ingests.
 
Rather,
 
the
 
system's
 
intelligence
 
is
 
strictly
 
bounded
 
by
 
its
 
ability
 
to
 
perceive
 
the
 
athlete's
 
context.
 
In
 
cybernetic
 
theory,
 
a
 
control
 
system
 
requires
 
a
 
feedback
 
loop
 
to
 
correct
 
errors
 
and
 
maintain
 
stability.
 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
human
 
performance,
 
objective
 
data
 
provides
 
the
 
result
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
(e.g.,
 
the
 
athlete
 
generated
 
300
 
watts),
 
but
 
it
 
often
 
fails
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
state
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
(e.g.,
 
the
 
athlete
 
generated
 
300
 
watts
 
while
 
experiencing
 
high
 
anxiety,
 
low
 
glycogen
 
availability,
 
and
 
significant
 
sleep
 
deprivation).
 
Without
 
explicit
 
User
 
Input
 
Parameters
 
(UIPs),
 
the
 
algorithm
 
operates
 
in
 
a
 
"black
 
box,"
 
making
 
assumptions
 
about
 
causality
 
that
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
non-functional
 
overreaching
 
or
 
undertraining.

This
 
report
 
presents
 
an
 
exhaustive
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
essential
 
user
 
input
 
parameters
 
required
 
to
 
construct
 
a
 
robust,
 
human-centric
 
adaptive
 
training
 
system.
 
It
 
synthesizes
 
research
 
from
 
physiological
 
monitoring,
 
psychometrics,
 
and
 
user
 
interface
 
design
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
taxonomy
 
of
 
inputs
 
across
 
the
 
athlete's
 
journey:
 
from
 
the
 
initial
 
initialization
 
of
 
goals
 
(The
 
Genesis
 
Vectors)
 
to
 
the
 
daily
 
assessment
 
of
 
capacity
 
(The
 
Readiness
 
Loop),
 
the
 
post-hoc
 
analysis
 
of
 
execution
 
(The
 
Feedback
 
Mechanism),
 
and
 
finally,
 
the
 
user
 
interface
 
logic
 
required
 
to
 
close
 
the
 
loop
 
(Dynamic
 
Adjustment).
 
The
 
analysis
 
reveals
 
that
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
algorithms
 
do
 
not
 
merely
 
automate
 
prescription;
 
they
 
facilitate
 
a
 
dialogue.
 
They
 
weigh
 
objective
 
metrics
 
against
 
subjective
 
reality,
 
utilizing
 
user
 
inputs
 
not
 
just
 
as
 
data
 
points,
 
but
 
as
 
"weighting
 
coefficients"
 
that
 
modulate
 
the
 
algorithmic
 
response
 
to
 
physiological
 
load.
3
 
As
 
we
 
explore
 
these
 
parameters,
 
it
 
becomes
 
evident
 
that
 
the
 
future
 
of
 
training
 
software
 
lies
 
in
 
minimizing
 
the
 
friction
 
of
 
these
 
inputs
 
while
 
maximizing
 
their
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
training
 
plan's
 
evolution.

The
 
Genesis
 
Vectors:
 
Goal
 
Setting
 
and
 
Initialization
 
Parameters
 
The
 
initialization
 
phase
 
of
 
an
 
adaptive
 
algorithm—commonly
 
presented
 
to
 
the
 
user
 
as
 
a
 
"Goal
 
Setting
 
Wizard"
 
or
 
"Onboarding
 
Flow"—is
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
juncture
 
for
 
algorithmic
 
accuracy.
 
This
 
phase
 
establishes
 
the
 
"North
 
Star"
 
metrics
 
against
 
which
 
all
 
future
 
adaptations
 
are
 
measured.
 
If
 
the
 
input
 
parameters
 
here
 
are
 
vague
 
or
 
poorly
 
structured,
 
the
 
algorithm’s
 
trajectory
 
will
 
be
 
fundamentally
 
flawed.
 
Research
 
into
 
goal-setting
 
theory
 
within
 
sports
 
psychology
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
necessity
 
of
 
the
 
SMART
 
framework
 
(Specific,
 
Measurable,
 
Achievable,
 
Relevant,
 
Time-bound).
4
 
A
 
sophisticated
 
ATA
 
must
 
translate
 
these
 
qualitative
 
concepts
 
into
 
quantitative
 
input
 
fields.
 
2.1
 
Event
 
Profiling
 
and
 
Prioritization
 
Logic
 
The
 
primary
 
vector
 
for
 
any
 
training
 
plan
 
is
 
the
 
target
 
event.
 
However,
 
a
 
single
 
date
 
is
 
insufficient
 
for
 
complex
 
periodization.
 
The
 
system
 
requires
 
a
 
high-resolution
 
"Event
 
Profile"
 
to
 
reverse-engineer
 
the
 
specific
 
physiological
 
demands—energy
 
systems,
 
biomechanical
 
loads,
 
and
 
environmental
 
stressors—that
 
the
 
athlete
 
must
 
be
 
prepared
 
to
 
endure.
 
2.1.1
 
Event
 
Hierarchies
 
and
 
Tapering
 
Logic
 
Adaptive
 
systems
 
must
 
force
 
users
 
to
 
prioritize
 
their
 
competitive
 
calendar.
 
It
 
is
 
physiologically
 
impossible
 
to
 
peak
 
for
 
every
 
event
 
in
 
a
 
season.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
goal
 
wizard
 
must
 
implement
 
a
 
tiered
 
priority
 
system,
 
commonly
 
categorized
 
as
 
A,
 
B,
 
and
 
C
 
races.
7
 
●
 
"A"
 
Race
 
(The
 
Peak):
 
The
 
algorithm
 
interprets
 
this
 
input
 
as
 
the
 
singular
 
focus
 
of
 
the
 
macrocycle.
 
It
 
triggers
 
the
 
calculation
 
of
 
a
 
full
 
taper
 
module,
 
typically
 
reducing
 
volume
 
by
 
40-60%
 
in
 
the
 
preceding
 
1-3
 
weeks
 
while
 
maintaining
 
intensity
 
to
 
shed
 
fatigue
 
and
 
maximize
 
freshness
 
(TSB
 
-
 
Training
 
Stress
 
Balance).
7
 
●
 
"B"
 
Race
 
(The
 
Test):
 
The
 
system
 
interprets
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
high-priority
 
training
 
day.
 
The
 
algorithm
 
may
 
schedule
 
a
 
"mini-taper"
 
(2-3
 
days
 
of
 
reduced
 
load)
 
but
 
will
 
not
 
disrupt
 
the
 
progressive
 
overload
 
of
 
the
 
mesocycle.
 
●
 
"C"
 
Race
 
(The
 
Workout):
 
The
 
system
 
treats
 
this
 
event
 
purely
 
as
 
a
 
substitute
 
for
 
a
 
high-intensity
 
session
 
(e.g.,
 
a
 
Threshold
 
workout).
 
No
 
tapering
 
is
 
applied.
 
Algorithmic
 
Constraint:
 
The
 
UI
 
must
 
enforce
 
logic
 
that
 
prevents
 
users
 
from
 
selecting
 
conflicting
 
priorities,
 
such
 
as
 
two
 
"A"
 
races
 
within
 
a
 
14-day
 
window,
 
which
 
would
 
violate
 
the
 
physiological
 
constraints
 
of
 
supercompensation
 
and
 
recovery.

2.1.2
 
Terrain
 
and
 
Environmental
 
Specificity
 
The
 
specific
 
topography
 
and
 
surface
 
of
 
an
 
event
 
significantly
 
alter
 
the
 
muscular
 
and
 
metabolic
 
demands.
 
A
 
marathon
 
on
 
flat
 
pavement
 
requires
 
different
 
biomechanical
 
adaptations
 
than
 
a
 
50km
 
trail
 
ultra-marathon
 
with
 
2,000
 
meters
 
of
 
vertical
 
gain.
 
Platforms
 
like
 
Best
 
Bike
 
Split
 
and
 
Vert.run
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
necessity
 
of
 
granular
 
terrain
 
inputs.

Surface
 
Type:
 
Users
 
must
 
select
 
between
 
Road,
 
Trail,
 
Track,
 
Gravel,
 
or
 
Mixed.
 
This
 
input
 
informs
 
the
 
algorithm
 
to
 
prescribe
 
specific
 
muscle-recruitment
 
workouts
 
(e.g.,
 
high-torque
 
low-cadence
 
work
 
for
 
climbing
 
vs.
 
high-cadence
 
work
 
for
 
track).
11
 
●
 
Aerodynamic
 
and
 
Gravitational
 
Constraints:
 
For
 
cycling,
 
inputs
 
regarding
 
the
 
course's
 
elevation
 
profile
 
allow
 
the
 
system
 
to
 
calculate
 
the
 
necessary
 
power-to-weight
 
ratio
 
(Watts/kg)
 
versus
 
absolute
 
power
 
(Watts/CdA)
 
required
 
for
 
success.

●
 
Technical
 
Difficulty:
 
In
 
trail
 
running,
 
a
 
"Technicality
 
Score"
 
input
 
allows
 
the
 
system
 
to
 
adjust
 
pace
 
expectations.
 
A
 
10km
 
run
 
on
 
technical
 
single-track
 
might
 
equate
 
to
 
the
 
physiological
 
load
 
of
 
a
 
15km
 
road
 
run.
 
Without
 
this
 
input,
 
the
 
algorithm
 
might
 
incorrectly
 
interpret
 
a
 
slow

run
 
as
 
a

Modeling
 
A
 
major
 
failure
 
mode
 
of
 
static
 
training
 
plans
 
is
 
the
 
"availability
 
mismatch,"
 
where
 
the
 
plan
 
prescribes
 
a
 
2-hour
 
workout
 
on
 
a
 
day
 
the
 
user
 
only
 
has
 
45
 
minutes.
 
To
 
avoid
 
constant
 
rescheduling,
 
the
 
initialization
 
phase
 
must
 
capture
 
the
 
user's
 
temporal
 
reality
.
 
2.2.1
 
Granular

their
 
weekly

on
 
a

basis.
18
 
●
 
Daily
 
Duration
 
Caps:
 
The
 
user
 
should
 
input
 
specific
 
windows
 
(e.g.,
 
"Tuesday:
 
06:00-07:00
 
AM").
 
This
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
hard
 
constraint
 
for
 
the
 
workout
 
generator.
 
If
 
a
 
physiological
 
adaptation
 
requires
 
90
 
minutes
 
of
 
Time-in-Zone,
 
but
 
the
 
user
 
has
 
only
 
60
 

---PAGE---

minutes,
 
the
 
algorithm
 
must
 
intelligently
 
substitute
 
a
 
higher-intensity,
 
shorter-duration
 
variant
 
(e.g.,
 
compressing
 
volume
 
into
 
intensity)
 
rather
 
than
 
prescribing
 
an
 
impossible
 
session.
20
 
●
 
Long
 
Run
 
Anchoring:
 
The
 
user
 
must
 
actively
 
select
 
the
 
day
 
for
 
their
 
longest
 
session.
 
While
 
traditionally
 
Sunday,
 
modern
 
work
 
schedules
 
vary.
 
This
 
input
 
anchors
 
the
 
weekly
 
microcycle,
 
with
 
the
 
algorithm
 
back-filling
 
intensity
 
and
 
recovery
 
days
 
relative
 
to
 
this
 
anchor
 
point.
19
 
2.2.2
 
Equipment
 
Inventory
 
and
 
Modality
 
The
 
"Inventory"
 
input
 
allows
 
the
 
algorithm
 
to
 
tailor
 
the
 
modality
 
of
 
the
 
stimulus.
 
●
 
Indoor
 
vs.
 
Outdoor:
 
An
 
input
 
specifying
 
"Indoor
 
Trainer
 
Available"
 
(e.g.,
 
Zwift,
 
Peloton)
 
allows
 
the
 
algorithm
 
to
 
prescribe
 
highly
 
specific
 
ergometer-mode
 
intervals
 
that
 
are
 
difficult
 
to
 
execute
 
outdoors
 
due
 
to
 
traffic
 
or
 
terrain.
11
 
●
 
Sensor
 
Availability:
 
The
 
system
 
must
 
know
 
if
 
the
 
user
 
is
 
training
 
with
 
Power,
 
Heart
 
Rate,
 
or
 
only
 
RPE
 
(Rate
 
of
 
Perceived
 
Exertion).
 
This
 
dictates
 
the
 
language
 
of
 
the
 
workout
 
prescription
 
(e.g.,
 
"Hold
 
250
 
Watts"
 
vs.
 
"Run
 
at
 
7/10
 
Effort").
22
 
2.3
 
Physiological
 
Baselining
 
and
 
History
 
Before
 
the
 
first
 
workout
 
is
 
generated,
 
the
 
system
 
establishes
 
a
 
baseline.
 
While
 
historical
 
data
 
files
 
provide
 
objective
 
history,
 
subjective
 
history
 
helps
 
gauge
 
resilience
.
 
●
 
Training
 
Age
 
and
 
History:
 
Questions
 
such
 
as
 
"How
 
many
 
years
 
have
 
you
 
been
 
training?"
 
and
 
"What
 
is
 
your
 
average
 
weekly
 
volume
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
6
 
months?"
 
help
 
calculate
 
the
 
user's
 
Chronic
 
Training
 
Load
 
(CTL).
 
This
 
prevents
 
the
 
"Too
 
Much,
 
Too
 
Soon"
 
error,
 
where
 
an
 
algorithm
 
might
 
prescribe
 
a
 
load
 
that
 
is
 
mathematically
 
optimal
 
but
 
orthopedically
 
dangerous
 
for
 
a
 
novice.
7
 
●
 
Current
 
Performance
 
Estimates:
 
Inputting
 
a
 
recent
 
5k
 
or
 
10k
 
time
 
(distinct
 
from
 
the
 
goal
 
time)
 
allows
 
the
 
system
 
to
 
triangulate
 
a
 
VO2
 
max
 
estimate
 
and
 
set
 
initial
 
zones.
25
 
●
 
Risk
 
Appetite:
 
A
 
unique
 
parameter
 
observed
 
in
 
TrainAsONE
 
is
 
the
 
"Risk
 
Level"
 
setting.
 
Users
 
can
 
explicitly
 
input
 
their
 
tolerance
 
for
 
injury
 
risk
 
in
 
exchange
 
for
 
faster
 
performance
 
gains.
 
A
 
"High
 
Risk"
 
input
 
allows
 
for
 
steeper
 
ramp
 
rates
 
in
 
volume
 
and
 
intensity,
 
while
 
"Low
 
Risk"
 
flattens
 
the
 
progression
 
curve.
27
 
This
 
psychometric
 
input
 
effectively
 
shifts
 
the

internal
 
safety

The
 
Daily
 
Control
 
Loop:
 
Readiness

Pre-Training
 
Inputs
 
Once
 
the
 
macro-plan
 
is
 
established,
 
the
 
system
 
enters
 
the
 
daily
 
control
 
loop.
 
The
 
fundamental
 
question
 
shifts
 
from
 
"What
 
should
 
the
 
athlete
 
do?"
 
to
 
"What
 
can
 
the

do
 
today?"
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
domain
 
of
 
Daily

Research
 
indicates
 
that
 
readiness

multi-factorial,

A
 
significantly
 
suppressed

Objective

are
 
prone
 
to
 
false

A
 
low
 
HRV
 
might
 
be
 
caused
 
by
 
a
 
late

or
 
mild
 
dehydration
 
rather
 
than
 
systemic

fatigue.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
"Human-in-the-Loop"
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
validate
 
the

This

The
 
Freshness
 
Feedback
 
Mechanism
 
(Xert)
 
The
 
Xert
 
platform
 
utilizes
 
a
 
sophisticated
 
"Freshness

slider,
 
allowing
 
users
 
to
 
manually
 
offset
 
the
 
algorithm's
 
calculated

●
 
Mechanism:
 
The
 
slider
 
ranges
 
from
 
-60
 
(Very
 
Tired)
 
to
 
+60
 
(Very
 
Fresh).
 
●
 
Application:
 
If
 
the
 
objective
 
model
 
calculates
 
a
 
"Fresh"
 
state
 
(Blue
 
status),
 
but
 
the
 
user
 
feels
 
lethargic
 
due
 
to
 
non-training
 
stressors
 
(work
 
stress,
 
travel),
 
dragging
 
the
 
slider
 
to
 
"-20"
 
instantly
 
updates
 
the
 
user's
 
"Form"
 
score.
 
This
 
real-time
 
input
 
triggers
 
the
 
Adaptive

(XATA)
 
to
 
downgrade
 
the

recommended
 
workout
 
from
 
a
 
high-intensity
 
"Breakthrough"

ride.
33
 
This

○
 
Design
 
Pattern:
 
This
 
notification
 
often
 
uses
 
color-coded
 
headers
 
(Red/Orange)
 
to
 
signal
 
urgency
 
and
 
blocks
 
the
 
standard
 
"Daily

view
 
to
 
force
 
the

●
 
Reactive
 
(Compliance-Based):
 
These

○
 
Example
 
(Runna):
 
"We

○
 
Design
 
Pattern:
 
A
 
"Plan

banner
 
appears
 
on
 
the
 
dashboard.
 
Clicking
 
it
 
reveals
 
a

(High
 
Trust).
54
 
●
 
Validation:
 
The
 
Whoop
 
interface
 
is
 
notable
 
for
 
its
 
"Recovery"
 
explanation,
 
explicitly
 
listing
 
which
 
factors
 
(Sleep,
 
HRV,
 
or
 
Sickness)
 
drove
 
the
 
score
 
down,
 
empowering
 
the

the
 
specific
 
root

28
 
5.2
 
Managing
 
Missed
 
Workouts:
 
The
 
Adjustment
 
Logic
 
The
 
UI
 
must
 
handle
 
non-compliance
 
without
 
inducing
 
guilt.
 
The
 
"Missed
 
Workout"
 
flow
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
retention
 
point.
 
●
 
User
 
Choice:
 
Platforms
 
like
 
Runna
 
allow
 
users
 
to
 
choose
 
the
 
adaptation
 
strategy.
 
○
 
Option
 
A:
 
Reschedule.
 
"Shift
 
my
 
plan
 
forward."
 
(Good
 
for
 
illness/injury
 
breaks).
 
○
 
Option
 
B:
 
Skip.
 
"Delete
 
this
 
run
 
and
 
recalculate."
 
(Good
 
for
 
busy
 
work
 
weeks).
 
The
 
algorithm
 
then
 
redistributes
 
the
 
critical
 
volume
 
to
 
future
 
sessions
 
or
 
accepts
 
a

slightly
 
lower

progression.
20
 
●
 
Algorithm-Led
 
Adaptation:
 
TrainAsONE
 
takes
 
a
 
more
 
automated
 
approach,
 
silently
 
recalculating
 
the
 
probability
 
of
 
hitting
 
the
 
race
 
goal.
 
If
 
too
 
many
 
workouts
 
are
 
missed,
 
the
 
UI
 
might
 
prompt
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
"Re-evaluate
 
Goal
 
Time"
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
new
 
reduced
 
training
 
volume.
18
 
5.3
 
Chat
 
Interfaces
 
and
 
LLM
 
Integration
 
The
 
cutting
 
edge
 
of
 
adaptive
 
UI
 
is
 
the
 
integration
 
of
 
Large
 
Language
 
Models
 
(LLMs)
 
to
 
facilitate
 
natural
 
language
 
coaching.
 
AI
 
Endurance
 
demonstrates
 
this
 
with
 
a
 
chatbot
 
that
 
allows
 
users
 
to
 
query
 
the
 
algorithm
 
logic
 
directly.
48
 
●
 
Scenario:
 
A
 
user
 
is
 
unsure
 
about
 
a
 
workout.
 
●
 
User
 
Query:
 
"I
 
feel
 
tired
 
today,
 
can
 
I
 
skip
 
the
 
intervals?"
 
●
 
System
 
Response:
 
"Your
 
HRV
 
is
 
normal,
 
but
 
your
 
subjective

without
 
the

stress.
 
Would
 
you
 
like
 
to
 
apply
 
this
 
change?"
 
●
 
Impact:
 
This
 
interaction
 
mimics
 
the
 
"Coach-Athlete"
 
negotiation,
 
significantly
 
increasing
 
user
 
trust
 
and
 
adherence
 
compared
 
to
 
a
 
silent,
 
automated

●
 
Concept:
 
A
 
5%
 
drop
 
in
 
readiness
 
might
 
be
 
normal
 
noise
 
for
 
User
 
A
 
(High

but
 
a
 
sign
 
of
 
illness
 
for
 
User
 
B
 
(Low
 
CV).
1
 
●
 
UI
 
Implementation:
 
Oura
 
and
 
Whoop
 
use
 
"Baseline
 
Ranges"
 
(shaded
 
areas
 
on
 
graphs).
 
The
 
user
 
is
 
only
 
notified
 
if
 
the
 
metric
 
falls
 
outside
 
this
 
normal
 
variance
 
range.
 
This
 
"Signal-to-Noise"
 
filtering
 
prevents
 
alert
 
fatigue
 
and
 
focuses
 
the
 
user
 
on
 
meaningful

Synthesis
 
and
 
Future
 
Architectures
 
The
 
evolution
 
of
 
adaptive
 
training
 
algorithms
 
is
 
a
 
convergence
 
of
 
objective
 
precision
 
and
 
subjective
 
context.
 
The
 
analysis
 
of
 
current
 
best
 
practices
 
reveals
 
that
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
systems
 
are
 
those
 
that
 
treat
 
User
 
Input
 
Parameters
 
not
 
as
 
secondary
 
metadata,
 
but
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
control
 
signals
 
for
 
the
 
periodization
 
engine.
 
The
 
ideal
 
architecture
 
for
 
a
 
next-generation
 
adaptive
 
system
 
must
 
be
 
built
 
on
 
four
 
pillars:
 
1.
 
Granular
 
Initialization:
 
A
 
Goal
 
Wizard
 
that
 
captures
 
the
 
full
 
dimensionality
 
of
 
the
 
event
 
(Terrain,
 
Priority)
 
and
 
the
 
user
 
(Constraints,
 
Risk
 
Appetite).
 
2.
 
Holistic
 
Readiness:
 
A
 
daily
 
loop
 
that
 
weights
 
biometric
 
data
 
(HRV,
 
Cycle
 
Phase)
 
with
 
direct
 
human
 
input
 
(Freshness,
 
Soreness)
 
to
 
determine
 
capacity.
 
3.
 
Diagnostic
 
Feedback:
 
A
 
post-activity
 
survey
 
that
 
distinguishes
 
between
 
physiological
 
failure
 
and
 
logistical
 
failure,
 
preventing
 
false
 
negatives
 
in
 
fitness
 
tracking.
 
4.
 
Transparent
 
Adaptation:
 
A
 
UI
 
that
 
explains
 
the
 
cause
 
of
 
every
 
plan
 
change,
 
utilizing
 
natural
 
language
 
and
 
visual
 
data
 
ranges
 
to
 
build
 
trust.
 
As
 
wearable
 
technology
 
evolves
 
to
 
include
 
continuous
 
glucose
 
monitoring
 
(CGM)
 
and
 
real-time
 
core
 
temperature
 
sensing,
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
objective
 
data
 
will
 
explode.
 
However,
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
Subjective
 
Input
 
will
 
only
 
increase.
 
In
 
a
 
sea
 
of
 
data,
 
the
 
user's
 
voice—their
 
motivation,
 
their
 
pain,
 
and
 
their
 
perception—remains
 
the
 
most
 
powerful
 
signal
 
for
 
determining
 
not
 
just
 
what
 
an
 
athlete
 
could
 
do,
 
but
 
what
 
they
 
will
 
do.
 
The
 
future
 
of
 
training
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
adaptive;
 
it
 
is
 
conversational.
 
7.
 
Conclusions
 
and
 
Recommendations
 
for
 
Algorithm
 
Design
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
synthesis
 
of
 
the
 
158
 
research
 
snippets
 
analyzed,
 
the
 
following
 
actionable
 
recommendations
 
are
 
provided
 
for
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
adaptive
 
training
 
software:
 
1.
 
Mandate
 
SMART
 
Goal
 
Inputs:
 
Do
 
not
 
allow
 
vague
 
goals.
 
Force
 
users
 
to
 
define
 
"A"
 
races
 
and
 
specific
 
time/completion
 
metrics
 
to
 
anchor
 
the
 
ATP.
4
 
2.
 
Implement
 
a
 
"Struggle
 
Survey"
 
Logic:
 
Never
 
interpret
 
a
 
missed
 
or
 
failed
 
workout
 
without
 
asking
 
"Why?"
 
Differentiate
 
between
 
physiological
 
limits
 
(lower
 
intensity)
 
and
 
logistical
 
limits
 
(ignore
 
data).
43
 
3.
 
Integrate
 
Women's
 
Health
 
by
 
Default:
 
Cycle
 
tracking
 
should
 
be
 
a
 
core
 
parameter,
 
not
 
an
 
add-on.
 
Algorithms
 
must
 
adjust
 
intensity
 
expectations
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
Follicular/Luteal
 
phase
 
metabolic
 
shifts.
38
 
4.
 
Visualize
 
the
 
"Why":
 
Avoid
 
black-box
 
adaptations.
 
Every
 
plan
 
change
 
must
 
be
 

---PAGE---

accompanied
 
by
 
a
 
natural
 
language
 
explanation
 
citing
 
the
 
specific
 
input
 
(e.g.,
 
"Due
 
to
 
low
 
sleep
 
score...")
 
that
 
triggered
 
it.
48
 
5.
 
Use
 
RPE
 
as
 
a
 
Validator:
 
Always
 
collect
 
RPE.
 
Use
 
the
 
delta
 
between
 
Planned
 
vs.
 
Actual
 
RPE
 
to
 
auto-correct
 
FTP
 
and
 
training
 
zones
 
without
 
improved
 
testing.
23
 
6.
 
Prioritize
 
Enjoyment
 
for
 
Adherence:
 
Track
 
workout
 
enjoyment.
 
If
 
a
 
user
 
hates
 
a
 
specific
 
modality,
 
the
 
algorithm
 
should
 
seek
 
physiological
 
equivalents
 
that
 
yield
 
higher
 
enjoyment
 
scores
 
to
 
prevent
 
churn.
49
 
By
 
implementing
 
these
 
parameters,
 
developers
 
can
 
move
 
beyond
 
static
 
"spreadsheets
 
in
 
an
 
app"
 
to
 
create
 
truly
 
responsive,
 
bio-digital
 
coaching
 
ecosystems
 
that
 
adapt
 
to
 
the
 
complex
 
reality
 
of
 
the
 
human
 
athlete.
