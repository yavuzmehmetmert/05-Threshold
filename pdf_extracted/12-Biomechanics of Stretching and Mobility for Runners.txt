Biomechanics of Stretching and Mobility for
Runners
Introduction:  Running performance is influenced by a complex interplay between flexibility, stiffness,
and neuromuscular reflexes. Coaches often face a paradox:  How much flexibility is beneficial, and
when  does  too  much  become  detrimental?  This  coaching  guide  delves  into  the  science  behind
stretching and mobility for runners. We will explore why a certain level of leg stiffness can enhance
running economy (the  “stiffness paradox” ), examine static vs. dynamic stretching and their effects on
performance, explain the stretch (myotatic) reflex and how techniques like PNF stretching can “hack” it
for gains, and discuss specific mobility needs in the hips and ankles that impact running form and injury
risk. Throughout, we’ll connect research findings to practical coaching insights.
1. The Stiffness Paradox: Finding the Sweet Spot in Flexibility
Leg Stiffness and Running Economy:  In running, the legs behave like springs under the spring-mass
model of locomotion . The body’s center of mass bounces on compliant limbs, and the  vertical
stiffness  of this spring-like system influences how efficiently a runner moves. A certain level of leg
stiffness is beneficial for running economy , which is the oxygen/energy cost to run at a given pace.
Studies have found that more economical runners often exhibit higher stiffness in their lower extremity
tendons or muscles, enabling better storage and return of elastic energy with each stride . For
example, stiffer muscles around the ankle and knee can potentiate force during the transition from
landing (braking) to push-off, acting like a taut spring that rebounds and propels the runner forward
more efficiently . In essence, a moderately stiff leg acts as a better pogo stick , conserving energy
and improving running performance .
Why Elastic Recoil Matters:  When your foot strikes the ground, energy is stored momentarily in
stretched tendons and muscles (particularly the Achilles tendon and arch of the foot). A stiff-leg spring
will recoil rapidly, returning that stored energy to help push off the ground. This contributes to running
economy by reducing the work the muscles must do. Research indicates that training methods which
increase ankle and knee joint stiffness can improve running economy and performance by enhancing
this elastic return . In practical terms, plyometric exercises or isometric strength training that raise
tendon stiffness might make a runner’s stride more energy-efficient by maximizing elastic recoil.
The Downside of Too Much Flexibility:  However , more flexibility is not always better for runners –
hence  the  “stiffness  paradox.”  There  is  an  optimal  range  of  stiffness  for  efficient  running,  and
excessive flexibility (over-compliance in the muscles or tendons) can reduce the elastic energy return. If
the leg spring is too soft  or compliant, it will absorb a lot of energy but not return it effectively – like a
loose spring that doesn’t snap back. The result is that the muscles have to expend more metabolic
energy to maintain speed . Researchers have noted that stretching to greatly increase flexibility can
lead to sub-optimal joint mechanics during running, where the muscle-tendon unit is too compliant  and
fails to recycle energy efficiently . In stretch-shortening cycle activities (like running), an  optimal
tendon stiffness  exists for maximizing power and efficiency . If a runner becomes overly flexible
beyond that optimum, the joints may lose some of the “springiness” that aids economy, causing a drop
in performance despite greater range of motion. In other words, excessive flexibility can dissipate energy
as heat or unnecessary movement, instead of channeling it into forward propulsion.1

Striking a Balance:  It’s important to note that while a baseline stiffness benefits running economy, this
doesn’t mean runners should avoid flexibility work altogether . Instead, the goal is to maintain the right
balance : enough mobility to move freely and prevent injury, but enough stiffness to harness elastic
recoil. For instance, elite middle-distance runners tend to have adequate flexibility for stride length but
also relatively stiff Achilles tendons to store and release energy. Conversely, a runner who is hypermobile
in the lower body might sacrifice some running efficiency. As one study summarized, there is a “delicate
balance  between  joint  flexibility,  musculotendinous  stiffness,  and  muscle  activation”  that  determines
running economy . Training should therefore aim to optimize that balance.
Coaching Takeaway:  For improved running economy, do not equate maximum flexibility with better
performance. Encourage runners to develop  functional flexibility  – the minimum range of motion
needed for an efficient stride – while using strength and plyometric training to build the appropriate leg
stiffness. Overstretching the lower legs right before a run could temporarily reduce the beneficial
spring tension. Instead, incorporate dynamic drills and strength work that enhance the leg’s spring-like
qualities. In short, maintain the springs in your legs – neither too tight nor too loose – for the best running
bounce.
2. Static vs. Dynamic Stretching: Which Is Better Before Running?
Before heading out for a run or race, how one stretches can significantly affect immediate performance.
Here we compare static and dynamic stretching and why they have very different effects on subsequent
running.
The  “Performance  Dampening”  Effect  of  Static  Stretching:  Static  stretching  involves  holding  a
stretch position (usually 20–60 seconds) to lengthen a muscle. While this can increase flexibility, doing
prolonged static stretches  right before  running can actually  diminish performance  in terms of force
and power output. Research has repeatedly shown that acute static stretching can lead to a temporary
loss in muscle strength, explosive performance, and running economy. One review found an average
decrease of about 3–4% in force production after static stretching of a muscle . In practical terms,
static stretching can make the muscles  too compliant  and lower their stiffness momentarily, which
reduces their ability to produce force quickly. This is sometimes called a  neuromuscular inhibitory
effect  – muscles that have been statically stretched may experience less neural drive and a slight loss of
elastic tension. For runners, this could translate to slower sprint times, reduced jump height, or a less
efficient stride immediately after stretching. Static stretching also elongates the muscle-tendon unit,
possibly reducing the amount of elastic energy it can store during the stretch-shortening cycle of
running.  Thus,  coaches  often  say  static  stretching  “dampens”  the  muscle’s  power  –  much  like
overstretching a rubber band so it doesn’t snap back as strongly.
Evidence:  In one study, athletes who performed static stretches before activity showed about a 
3.7–4.4% drop in strength/power output , whereas skipping static stretching (or doing dynamic
warm-ups instead) avoided this deficit . The temporary reduction in performance from static
stretching has been attributed to factors such as decreased muscle-tendon stiffness, altered
muscle contractile protein behavior , and reflex inhibition (the nervous system holding back a
little to protect the muscle). For runners, this could mean a decrease in running economy or top-
end speed right after static stretching.
Dynamic Stretching and Its Neurological Benefits:  Dynamic stretching involves active movements
that take joints through their range of motion – for example, leg swings, skipping, lunges with a twist,
butt kicks, etc. Rather than holding a muscle in a lengthened position, dynamic stretches continuously
move the muscles and tendons. Dynamic stretching before running tends to enhance performance
instead of impairing it. These movements function as a specific warm-up , raising muscle temperature,6

improving  blood  flow,  and  waking  up  the  nervous  system.  Unlike  static  stretches,  dynamic  drills
maintain  or  even  increase  muscle-tendon  stiffness  in  a  beneficial  way  and  prime  the  muscles  for
explosive action . 
Neurological “Pre-Activation”:  Dynamic stretching exercises stimulate the nervous system. By
mimicking aspects of the running movement (but in a controlled manner), they activate motor
units – essentially “rehearsing” the muscle firing patterns needed for running. This leads to
increased motor unit recruitment  and excitability right before the run . For example, doing
a series of high-knee skips or leg swings will activate the hip flexors and extensors, signaling
those muscles to be ready for action. Research indicates that dynamic warm-ups can increase
muscle  electromyographic  activity,  meaning  the  muscles  are  neurologically  more  ready  to
produce  force .  This  pre-activation  reduces  the  electro-mechanical  delay  in  muscle
contraction and can improve subsequent power output.
Temperature  and  Blood  Flow:  Dynamic  movements  also  increase  core  and  muscle
temperature , as well as heart rate, more effectively than static stretching . A warmer muscle
contracts more forcefully and relaxes faster . Even a slight increase in muscle temperature (1–2°C)
can improve muscle elasticity and speed of nerve impulses. By elevating core temperature and
stimulating circulation, dynamic stretching reduces joint stiffness (in terms of ease of movement)
without eliminating the muscle’s elastic stiffness needed for running economy . This is why
coaches often include calisthenics, strides, or mobility drills in warm-ups – they literally warm the
body and prep the neuromuscular system.
Comparative Research:  In contrast to static stretching’s performance dampening, dynamic stretching
has been associated with neutral or positive effects on running performance. For instance, studies
noted a slight  increase (~1–2%) in subsequent performance  after dynamic stretching routines .
Athletes feel more “ready” and reactive. One review (Behm et al. 2015) reported that while static/PNF
stretching immediately before exercise caused small performance impairments, dynamic stretching led
to a small performance increase (~1.3% improvement in strength/power)  on average . Although
1–2% might sound minor , in competitive terms this could mean the difference between a sluggish and a
sharp start in a race.
Why the Difference?  To summarize the science:
Static  Stretching  (pre-run)  –  Pros:  increases  flexibility  and  range  of  motion.  Cons:  Can
temporarily  reduce  muscle  strength,  power ,  and  running  economy  due  to  loss  of  optimal
stiffness and neural inhibition . Muscles may become “too relaxed” to generate explosive
force immediately. Not ideal right before high-performance running.
Dynamic Stretching (pre-run)  – Pros:  elevates heart rate and body temperature, engages the
nervous system, and can improve subsequent performance by enhancing muscle activation
. Maintains functional stiffness and may improve running economy by optimizing the stretch-
shortening cycle. Cons:  Does not increase long-term static flexibility as much as static stretching
(dynamic stretching is more for warm-up than improving splits or reach). Highly recommended
as part of warm-ups for runners.
Bullet Summary – Static vs Dynamic Warm-Up:
Static Stretching (Before Running):  Characterized by holding stretches for ~30 seconds. Tends
to reduce immediate force output  and can impair running explosiveness by ~4% due to decreased8

muscle-tendon stiffness and neural drive . Best saved for after running or separate flexibility
sessions (if needed) rather than right before a competition or speed workout. 
Dynamic Stretching (Before Running):  Involves controlled leg swings, arm circles, lunges, and
other active motions. Enhances performance  by increasing muscle temperature and activating
neural pathways. Improves subsequent running economy or power by priming motor units and
increasing blood flow . Should be a cornerstone of the pre-run routine to “turn on” the
body.
Coaching Takeaway:  For runners,  ditch the prolonged static stretch routine in your warm-up .
Instead, use dynamic drills to prepare. Static stretches have their place in improving flexibility, but
performing them immediately before running can make you feel sluggish. On the other hand, dynamic
stretching (like leg swings, high knees, skipping drills) before running will make you feel looser  and
more  powerful.  Save  static  stretching  for  cooldowns  or  separate  sessions,  and  make  dynamic
movements your go-to pre-run stretching strategy to boost performance rather than dampen it.
3. The Myotatic Stretch Reflex and PNF: Hacking the Nervous
System for Flexibility
When  we  talk  about  stretching  and  flexibility,  we  must  consider  the  body’s  built-in  protective
mechanisms. The  myotatic reflex , also simply known as the stretch reflex, is the body’s automatic
defense against muscle tearing. Understanding this reflex (and its counterpart, the Golgi tendon reflex)
will shed light on how advanced stretching techniques like PNF manage to improve range of motion by
essentially “tricking” the nervous system.
The Stretch (Myotatic) Reflex – Guarding Against Overstretch:  If you’ve ever had a doctor tap just
below your kneecap and seen your leg kick out, you’ve witnessed the stretch reflex in action. Receptors
in our muscles called muscle spindles  monitor the length and speed of stretch of the muscle. When a
muscle is stretched too quickly or beyond its comfort zone, the muscle spindles fire off signals to the
spinal cord. The spinal cord, in turn, sends a reflex impulse back to the muscle telling it to contract . This
is an involuntary response – essentially the muscle tightening up to prevent being stretched to the point
of injury. The stretch reflex is a monosynaptic reflex (a direct single connection in the spinal cord), which
is why it is so fast. Its purpose is to resist sudden lengthening of the muscle, thereby protecting the
muscle from tearing . For example, if you stumble and your ankle twists, the calf muscles rapidly contract
via the stretch reflex to stabilize the joint and prevent excessive stretch that could cause a strain.
This  protective  mechanism  means  that  during  stretching,  especially  ballistic  stretching  (bouncing
stretches), the muscle might reflexively contract against the stretch. Anyone who has tried to stretch a
very tight hamstring aggressively might feel the muscle trembling or tightening – that’s partly the
stretch reflex kicking in.
The Golgi Tendon Organ Reflex – Preventing Over-Contracting:  Another safety mechanism involves
the  Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) , which are sensors located in the tendons near the muscle-tendon
junction. Whereas muscle spindles respond to stretch, GTOs respond to tension . If a muscle generates
extremely high tension (for instance, lifting a very heavy weight or during a strong contraction), the
GTOs fire signals that cause the muscle to relax. This is known as  autogenic inhibition  – a reflex
inhibition of the muscle experiencing high tension . In simple terms, when tension could become
damaging, the body eases off to protect itself. It’s a “safety valve” to prevent the muscle or tendon from
ripping due to excessive force. Autogenic inhibition is  “a reflex of sudden relaxation of a muscle upon
development of high tension – a self-induced, inhibitory negative feedback mechanism that protects against
muscle tear.”  For example, if you try to lift something incredibly heavy, you might experience your7

muscles giving out or shaking – that’s the GTO-mediated reflex reducing the muscle’s contraction to
save it from injury.
PNF Stretching – Using Reflexes to Increase Range of Motion: Proprioceptive Neuromuscular
Facilitation (PNF)  is a advanced stretching technique that takes advantage of these neural reflexes to
achieve greater flexibility gains. Rather than simply holding a stretch, PNF typically involves alternating
between muscle contractions and stretches. Two common PNF methods are the  contract-relax (CR)
technique and the  contract-relax-antagonist-contract (CRAC)  technique. Here’s how they work and
“hack” the system:
Contract-Relax (CR) Method:  The target muscle (the one being stretched) is first passively
stretched to a comfortable end range. Then the athlete performs an isometric contraction  of
that same muscle (usually ~5–10 seconds pushing against resistance). For example, if stretching
hamstrings, you would push your leg down as if to contract the hamstrings against a partner’s
resistance, without actually moving the leg. This strong contraction activates the GTOs in the
tendon, generating high tension. When the athlete then relaxes  the contraction, the GTO-induced
autogenic inhibition reflex  kicks in, causing the target muscle to temporarily relax more than
usual . Immediately, the partner (or the athlete themselves) then gently pushes the stretch
further  into  the  new  range  for  ~10–15  seconds.  Because  the  muscle’s  stretch  reflex  is
momentarily subdued (and muscle tension is reduced thanks to the GTO response), the muscle
can be lengthened further than before. This sequence can be repeated several times, each time
hopefully gaining a few more degrees of motion.
Contract-Relax-Antagonist-Contract (CRAC) Method:  This approach adds an extra step. After
the initial isometric contraction of the target muscle, the athlete then actively contracts the
opposing muscle  (the antagonist). For instance, after contracting the hamstrings and relaxing,
you would actively contract the hip flexors/quadriceps to lift the leg further into the stretch.
Contracting the antagonist produces a phenomenon called  reciprocal inhibition  – when one
muscle group is activated, the opposite group is neurologically inhibited from contracting . By
firing the hip flexors, the nervous system automatically reduces tone in the hamstrings (their
antagonists) even more, allowing a deeper stretch . The result is an even greater increase in
range. Reciprocal inhibition is basically the body’s way of saying “if the mover is working, the
opposite muscle must relax to allow the movement” . PNF leverages this to increase flexibility:
the target muscle is inhibited both by its own GTO reflex (autogenic inhibition after the isometric
contraction) and by the antagonist contraction (reciprocal inhibition), maximizing relaxation and
stretch.
Using these techniques, PNF stretching effectively  overrides the normal protective reflexes  for a
short window, permitting the muscle to be stretched to a new length safely. Importantly, once the
stretch is released, the muscle doesn’t immediately spring back to its old length – over time, with
repeated PNF sessions, the muscle’s tolerance to stretch and its resting length can increase, leading to
lasting flexibility improvements.
Why PNF Increases Flexibility More:  Research confirms that PNF stretching can lead to greater gains
in range of motion than standard static stretching . By engaging the neuromuscular system (hence
“neuromuscular facilitation”), PNF achieves a greater magnitude of muscle lengthening . One review
noted that PNF techniques cause larger increases in both passive and active range of motion compared
to static or ballistic stretching . The combination of autogenic and reciprocal inhibition, along with
the viscous properties of muscle (creep and stress relaxation under tension), allows muscles to extend
further . Essentially, PNF is teaching the nervous system to accept a new, longer resting length for the
muscle by reducing the resistance it normally puts up.1.

It should be noted that right after PNF stretching, muscle performance can be temporarily reduced
(similar to static stretching) if done immediately before an activity – since it induces a deep relaxation of
the muscle. However , when done in cool-downs or separate sessions, PNF helps increase flexibility
without  the  same  degree  of  performance  loss.  In  fact,  if  consistently  done  over  weeks  (but  not
immediately before competition), it can increase functional ROM and even possibly improve strength at
those new ranges.
Real-World  Example:  To  illustrate,  imagine  a  runner  with  tight  hip  flexors  trying  to  improve  hip
extension flexibility. Using PNF, the runner can get into a lunge stretch (stretching the hip flexor), then
actively contract the hip flexor (as if trying to straighten up against the stretch) – this contraction
activates the GTO in the hip flexor . After holding, the runner relaxes and then contracts the glute of that
same leg (antagonist to the hip flexor) to deepen the lunge stretch. The hip flexor muscle is now more
relaxed due to the neurological tricks, allowing a greater stretch than a basic static hold would yield.
Repeating this process can significantly increase hip extension range over time, which could improve
the runner’s stride length and reduce injury risk.
Key Reflex Concepts for Coaches:
Stretch Reflex (Muscle Spindle):  A fast reflex causing muscle contraction in response to quick or
excessive stretch – protects muscle from overstretching. (Example: sudden hamstring stretch
triggers it to contract and resist). 
Autogenic Inhibition (Golgi Tendon Organ reflex):  A reflex causing muscle relaxation when high
tension is detected in the tendon – protects against tearing under excessive force . (Example:
during a maximal calf contraction, GTOs trigger the calf to relax if tension is too great.) 
Reciprocal Inhibition:  When one muscle contracts, its opposite (antagonist) is reflexively inhibited
to allow movement . (Example: firing the hip flexors causes the hamstrings to relax, so your
leg can swing forward freely). 
PNF stretching cleverly uses these reflexes by first  eliciting them  (through isometric contraction) and
then capitalizing on the momentary muscle relaxation  to stretch further . The result is a greater range
of motion than the muscle would normally allow on its own. 
Coaching Takeaway:  The nervous system often limits flexibility via reflexes to keep us safe. Techniques
like PNF teach the body to temporarily set those limits a bit higher , yielding improved flexibility. Coaches
and therapists can use PNF (contract-relax stretching) after workouts or in separate flexibility sessions
to improve an athlete’s range of motion in a targeted way.  Never force a stretch  – instead, use the
body’s own reflex circuitry to “trick”  the muscle into giving you more length. This results in safe flexibility
gains that can translate into better functional movement. Always ensure the athlete is warmed up
before doing PNF, and communicate to avoid overstretching. With practice, the nervous system adapts,
and  the  protective  reflex  threshold  raises,  allowing  greater  flexibility  without  compromising  joint
stability.
4. Specific Mobility Needs for Runners: Hips and Ankles
Every runner’s form and efficiency depend not only on general flexibility or stiffness, but also on the
mobility of key joints. Two of the most critical areas are the hips  (especially hip extension ability) and
the ankles  (dorsiflexion ability). Limitations in either can impair running mechanics and potentially lead
to injuries. Let’s examine each:•

Hip Extension Limits and Glute Activation (Reciprocal Inhibition)
Efficient running, especially at faster paces, requires good hip extension  – the ability to extend the leg
backward at the hip during the push-off phase. The primary muscles that produce hip extension are the
gluteus maximus and, to a degree, the hamstrings. However , many runners (especially those who sit for
long periods) struggle with tight hip flexors (like the iliopsoas and rectus femoris). Tight hip flexors
resist backward movement of the thigh, effectively limiting hip extension . 
When a runner has restricted hip extension  due to tight hip flexors, a couple of problems arise:
Shorter Stride and Altered Mechanics:  The runner cannot extend the leg far behind the body,
which  shortens  their  stride  length.  They  may  compensate  by  arching  the  lower  back  or
overstriding with the other leg, neither of which is optimal. Limited hip extension can also
reduce how effectively the glutes fire to push the body forward; the push-off becomes more
reliant on the calves or lower back, potentially reducing power and efficiency.
Reciprocal Inhibition of the Glutes:  Reciprocal inhibition means that when one muscle group is
active or chronically tight, it can cause the opposite group to have reduced activation . In the
context of the hips, if the  hip flexors are tight or overly active, they can neurologically
inhibit the gluteus maximus . The body essentially says “the hip is flexed or held in a shortened
position, so the hip extensor should remain relatively relaxed.” This is a survival of movement
patterns: muscles on one side of a joint relax to accommodate contraction on the other side .
Unfortunately for runners, this  “inhibition”  means the glutes – which are critical for running
power – may not engage fully if the hip flexors are very tight. Some coaches refer to this
phenomenon colloquially as “sleepy glutes” or  gluteal amnesia , where the glutes aren’t firing
when  they  should,  largely  because  opposing  muscles  (hip  flexors)  are  dominating  the  hip
position.
This reciprocal inhibition can create a vicious cycle: tight hip flexors lead to weak/inactive glutes, and
weak glutes mean the hip flexors have to do more to lift the leg each stride (or the runner relies on
other muscles like hamstrings or quads), which further reinforces the imbalance.
Impact on Running Performance and Injury:  Inefficient glute activation due to tight hip flexors can
harm running economy and performance. The gluteus maximus is the largest muscle in the body and a
powerhouse for hip extension; if it’s not contributing enough, the runner loses out on a major source of
propulsion. They might have a shorter , shuffling stride and reduced power on hills or sprints. Moreover ,
other muscles will pick up the slack – hamstrings may overwork to extend the hip, and the lumbar spine
may  hyperextend  to  compensate,  potentially  leading  to  lower  back  strain .  Tight  hip  flexors  also
contribute to an anterior pelvic tilt posture, which can put extra stress on the lower back.
From an injury standpoint, chronically tight hip flexors and underactive glutes can be associated with
issues like  hamstring strains  (because hamstrings get overtaxed),  low back pain , and even knee
problems (as the alignment of the pelvis and femur is affected, potentially altering knee mechanics).
Ensuring adequate hip extension mobility can help avert these issues.
Improving Hip Extension Mobility:  The solution is twofold – lengthen the hip flexors and activate/
strengthen the glutes.  Stretching the hip flexors (e.g., kneeling lunge stretches for the iliopsoas, and
stretches for the quads/rectus femoris) will help give the hip joint more extension range. But equally
important is waking up the glutes so they can take advantage of that range. Glute activation exercises
(like glute bridges, hip thrusts, monster walks, etc.) teach the body to fire the glutes even if the hip• 
•

---PAGE---

flexors have been tight. Over time, this can rewire the reciprocal inhibition effect: as the glutes become
stronger and more active, they can better co-exist with the hip flexors. You essentially restore a healthy
balance where the hip flexors can relax when the glutes engage , and vice versa, as intended.
Coaching Tip:  Many runners will benefit from a regular routine of  hip flexor stretches  and  glute
activation drills . For example, after runs (when muscles are warm) do a 1–2 minute hip flexor stretch
per side, focusing on a posterior pelvic tilt to truly stretch the iliopsoas. Follow this with a set of glute
bridges or single-leg bridges to reinforce hip extension using the glutes. By consistently doing this, a
runner can gradually increase their hip extension mobility. They’ll notice an ability to push off further
behind them, which means a more powerful stride. Even a few degrees more of hip extension (achieved
by loosening tight flexors) can translate to a longer stride and better running economy. And from a
reflex standpoint, reducing tension in the hip flexors will dial down the reciprocal inhibition on the
glutes, unlocking  more of the glutes’ strength.
In  summary,  tight  hip  flexors  inhibit  glute  activation  via  reciprocal  inhibition ,  limiting  a
runner’s  power.  Coaches  should  ensure  their  athletes  address  this  by  stretching  what’s  tight  (hip
flexors) and strengthening what’s weak (glutes). The result is improved hip range, stronger push-off,
and a lower risk of the injuries and inefficiencies associated with the so-called “tight-hips, weak-glutes”
syndrome.
Ankle Dorsiflexion: The Key to Shock Absorption and Achilles Health
Moving down the body, the ankle joint’s mobility , specifically dorsiflexion  (the ability to bend the foot
upward toward the shin), is critically important for runners. During the stance phase of running (when
the foot is on the ground and the body is moving over it), the ankle needs to dorsiflex to allow the shin
to move forward and to absorb impact. If a runner lacks sufficient dorsiflexion, it can have several
repercussions:
Shock Absorption:  The ankle joint is one of the first lines of shock absorption when the foot strikes the
ground. Adequate dorsiflexion allows the ankle to bend and absorb impact forces gradually , rather
than abruptly. Think of dorsiflexion as the ankle’s suspension system – like the shocks on a car . If the
ankle can flex smoothly, it helps attenuate the ground reaction forces as the runner’s weight loads onto
the leg. The calf muscles (particularly the soleus) control this dorsiflexion eccentrically, acting as springs
that slow the rate of ankle bend and then help push off. 
When ankle mobility is limited (i.e., the ankle is stiff and cannot dorsiflex enough), the impact forces
may be displaced elsewhere – often to the knee (leading to higher knee loads) or to the foot/heel itself
(which can strain the plantar fascia or Achilles tendon). A stiff ankle (limited dorsiflexion) results in a
more jarring, less compliant landing. The vertical stiffness of the runner increases, which can reduce
running economy and increase injury risk. Studies have shown that runners with higher leg stiffness
can  sometimes  incur  greater  impact  forces  unless  compensated  by  other  joints .  Ideally,  some
compliance at the ankle (through dorsiflexion) helps cushion each landing.
Achilles Tendon Stress and Tendinopathy:  The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel.
It stores and releases elastic energy with each step, but it also undergoes significant strain during
running.  Insufficient  ankle  dorsiflexion  is  a  known  risk  factor  for  Achilles  tendon  injuries
(tendinopathy) . If a runner cannot dorsiflex enough, what often happens is the heel might lift off
prematurely during stance or the foot compensates by overpronating (rolling in) to get more range.
Both scenarios can increase the load on the Achilles. For example, lacking dorsiflexion means the calf-
Achilles unit is tighter; as the body moves forward over the foot, the Achilles may be forced to stretch11

more than normal if the ankle joint doesn’t provide the motion. This added strain, over thousands of
steps, can irritate the tendon.
Clinical observations and research have linked  limited dorsiflexion range of motion to a higher
incidence  of  Achilles  tendinopathy  and  calf  strains.  In  one  context,  stiffness  in  the  lower  limb
(meaning  joints  that  resist  normal  range  of  motion)  was  noted  as  a  factor  in  Achilles  issues .
Essentially, a less mobile ankle (high stiffness) means the Achilles tendon endures higher tension forces
because the motion has to come from stretching the tendon instead of the ankle joint moving. Over
time, this can lead to degeneration in the tendon. Some studies of injured runners have found that
those with Achilles injuries often have significantly reduced dorsiflexion in the affected leg compared to
uninjured individuals.
Proper Ankle Mechanics in Running:  When dorsiflexion is adequate, here’s what happens during a
normal stride: As the runner’s foot lands (midfoot or forefoot strike, for instance), the ankle flexes
smoothly, allowing the shin to rotate forward over the foot. The arch and Achilles tendon absorb energy
like a spring. At a certain point (mid-stance), the Achilles is loaded and then the calf muscles contract to
plantarflex (push off), releasing that energy to propel the runner . If dorsiflexion is ample, the Achilles
experiences a healthy stretch within normal range – contributing to elastic recoil – but not an excessive
strain. If dorsiflexion is lacking, the runner might hit an end-range quickly, causing either a heel lift  (less
surface area on the ground, reducing stability and forcing calf to work harder) or pronation or a
combination of both to compensate. These compensations can decrease efficiency and concentrate
stress where it shouldn’t be.
Preventing Injuries with Ankle Mobility:  To reduce injury risk such as Achilles tendinopathy, ensuring
good ankle dorsiflexion is crucial. This can be addressed by maintaining flexibility in the calf muscles
(gastrocnemius and soleus) and mobility in the ankle joint capsule. Calf tightness is a common cause of
limited dorsiflexion. Regular calf stretching (both with knee straight for gastrocnemius and knee bent
for soleus) will help improve the range. Additionally, doing ankle mobility drills – like the classic “knee-
to-wall” dorsiflexion exercise where you try to touch your knee to the wall with your foot a certain
distance  away  –  can  help  safely  push  the  boundaries  of  ankle  motion.  Strengthening  the  calf  in
dorsiflexed positions (for instance, doing calf raises on a step, dropping the heel below the step to train
that end range) can also increase functional dorsiflexion.
From a coaching perspective, note that ankle dorsiflexion can be limited not just by soft tissue (muscles/
tendons) but also by joint impingement (bone or anterior ankle capsule tightness). If a runner has a
significant block to ankle motion, it might need specific mobility work or even therapy to address. But
generally, most runners benefit from some calf stretching and ankle mobilization.
Benefits of Good Ankle Mobility:  When a runner has adequate dorsiflexion: - They  absorb shock
better . The impact is dissipated through controlled ankle flexion rather than jolting the knee or hip. This
can manifest as lower impact peaks on a force plate and possibly reduced injury risk to joints. - They can
utilize  the  Achilles  tendon’s  elastic  recoil  optimally .  With  the  right  amount  of  dorsiflexion,  the
Achilles stores energy and then releases it like a rubber band, aiding push-off (which improves running
economy). If the ankle is too stiff, the tendon might not stretch enough to store energy (or conversely, if
forced, might overstretch and get injured). If it’s too lax, energy might dissipate. Again, it’s about
optimal compliance. - They often have a  smoother, more efficient gait . Insufficient dorsiflexion can
cause a clunky, up-and-down motion (because the leg can’t roll forward smoothly), whereas adequate
mobility allows a fluid transition from landing to toe-off.
Research  in  biomechanics  indicates  that  improving  ankle  range  can  modestly  improve  running
economy in some cases, likely by enabling better energy transfer and reducing resistance. Moreover ,15

interventions  aimed  at  increasing  dorsiflexion  (like  eccentric  calf  training)  have  been  successful  in
treating and preventing Achilles tendinopathies, underlining how vital that range is for tendon health.
Coaching Tip:  Routinely check your athletes’ ankle dorsiflexion . A simple test is the knee-to-wall test:
have the athlete kneel or stand in a lunge and see how far they can drive their knee over their toes with
the heel down. If it’s significantly less on one side or less than a few inches beyond the toes, dorsiflexion
is limited. Incorporate exercises to improve this, such as: - Calf stretches:  After runs, do wall or step calf
stretches (30+ seconds each) to lengthen the gastrocnemius and soleus. - Ankle mobility drills:  e.g.,
the  runner’s  lunge  –  drive  the  knee  forward  and  back,  10–15  repetitions,  keeping  the  heel  down,
perhaps with light pressure from hands or a band for assistance. - Eccentric heel drops:  Stand on a
step, rise up on both toes, then stand on one leg and slowly lower the heel down below the step. This
strengthens the calf and increases tendon flexibility (a proven method for Achilles tendon rehab and
dorsiflexion gains).
Ensuring good ankle mobility will help the runner’s form and may prevent common injuries like Achilles
tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis (often related to tight calves and limited dorsiflexion), and even knee
pain. It allows the runner to  run “softer”  – each footstrike having a bit of give – and then spring
forward effectively. Remember , mobility is not just about flexibility, but about control in that range. So
combining stretching with strengthening (like calf raises through full range) is ideal.
In  conclusion,  ankle  dorsiflexion  is  critical  for  shock  absorption  and  Achilles  tendon  health .
Runners with restricted ankle mobility have stiffer , more injury-prone mechanics , whereas those
with adequate dorsiflexion can capitalize on the Achilles’ elastic properties and reduce undue stress on
the tendon. Coaches should treat ankle mobility with as much importance as hip or hamstring flexibility
in their training programs for runners.
Final Thoughts:  Flexibility and mobility training for runners should be highly specific. The goal is not to
turn  runners  into  gymnasts,  but  to  ensure  they  have  the  necessary  range  of  motion  to  move
efficiently and stay injury-free, while preserving the  stiffness  needed for elastic energy return. The
stiffness paradox  reminds us that more is not always better when it comes to flexibility – finding the
optimal stiffness leads to better running economy . The comparison of static vs dynamic stretching
highlights that timing and context matter; use the right type of stretching at the right time to either
prepare the body for performance or to develop flexibility. Understanding the body’s reflexes (myotatic
reflex and GTO response) gives insight into why our muscles sometimes fight a stretch, and methods
like PNF show how we can intelligently work with the nervous system to safely improve range .
Finally, honing in on key joints like the hips and ankles addresses the specific mobility needs  of runners –
unlocking hip extension for stronger glutes, and ankle dorsiflexion for better shock absorption and
injury prevention. 
By integrating these principles, coaches and runners can develop a mobility routine that supports their
training  rather  than  detracts  from  it.  A  well-designed  flexibility  and  mobility  program  will  keep  a
runner’s stride strong, efficient, and resilient  mile after mile. ♂♀
