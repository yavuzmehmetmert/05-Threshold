Critical Power (CP) and W′ in Endurance Running
Power-Time Hyperbolic Relationship and Critical Power (CP)
Endurance performance follows a  hyperbolic relationship  between power output and the time to
exhaustion. If an athlete sustains a higher power , they fatigue faster , and conversely, they can sustain
lower powers for much longer . When plotting power vs. time-to-fatigue from multiple exhaustive trials
(e.g. efforts lasting ~2 to 15 minutes), the curve levels off  toward an asymptote . This asymptote is
called  Critical Power (CP)  – the power output that can be sustained for a very long time without
exhaustion . Mathematically, one form of this model is: 
or equivalently . This means the time to exhaustion  at any constant power  above CP is
inversely proportional to how far  exceeds CP . As  approaches CP from above, the sustainable
duration  grows very large (approaching infinity in theory), illustrating that CP is an asymptotic “fatigue
threshold.” In simpler terms, CP separates steady-state vs. non-steady-state intensities : exercise at
CP or below can reach a metabolic steady-state, whereas exercise above CP causes progressive fatigue
until exhaustion .
In running, the same concept is often expressed as critical speed (CS)  with a similar hyperbolic speed–
time curve (and a corresponding  D′ in meters, analogous to W′) . Whether using power (watts) or
speed (m/s), CP/CS represents the boundary between the “heavy” exercise domain (sustainable, steady
physiology) and the “severe” domain where fatigue inexorably accumulates .
W′ (W Prime) – Finite Work Capacity Above CP
W′ (W prime)  is the model parameter that quantifies the finite amount of work  an athlete can perform
above their CP. It is effectively the curvature constant of the power–duration hyperbola . In practical
terms, W′ is measured in energy units (joules or kilojoules) and represents a fixed “work capacity” that
can be expended when exercising above CP . Once this extra work capacity is used up, fatigue is
so high that the athlete must stop – this corresponds to exhaustion.
Importantly, W′ is constant for a given individual  (at a given fitness level) and does not depend on
how it’s expended. Whether an athlete sprints briefly or maintains a moderately hard pace for longer , as
long as the work done above CP equals their W′, they will reach the limit of tolerance . For example,
if an athlete’s CP is 300 W and W′ is 20 kJ, then sustaining 400 W (which is 100 W above CP) would
theoretically exhaust their W′ in about  (since 100 J/s is the rate above CP).
If they only ride at 330 W (30 W above CP), exhaustion would come later , around  
seconds, because W′ is burned more slowly. In other words, the closer the exercise intensity is to CP,
the longer it takes to use up W′ . W′ can thus be imagined as an energy reserve or “anaerobic
capacity” (historically termed anaerobic work capacity) that fuels work above CP. However , it’s not purely
a fixed store of one substrate – it reflects a mix of physiological resources (phosphocreatine, anaerobic
glycolysis,  oxygen  stores)  and  the  tolerable  accumulation  of  fatigue  byproducts .  It  remains
remarkably  constant  across  various  high-intensity  exercises;  exhaustion  in  the  severe  domain1

consistently coincides with roughly the same W′ expended and similar levels of muscle metabolites,
regardless of pacing strategy .
W′ Depletion in Intervals and Exponential Recovery (W′ Balance
Model)
During intermittent exercise  with work and rest intervals, the critical power model can be extended to
track W′ usage and recovery in real time. The assumptions are: when power output  exceeds CP , the
athlete  draws  from  their  W′  store  (depleting  it),  and  when  power  falls  below  CP ,  the  W′  can
reconstitute  (recover)  partially .  Researchers  formalized  this  with  the  concept  of  W′  balance
(W′_bal)  – essentially keeping a running tally of how much of W′ remains at any given moment .
W′ depletion:  Above CP, W′ is expended in a roughly linear fashion. In fact, for a constant power > CP,
the rate  of W′ usage is approximately  (in J/s). This linear utilization is why a hard bout 50 W
above CP will burn through W′ twice as fast as a bout 25 W above CP . Complete exhaustion occurs
when the cumulative work above CP equals the entire W′ (at which point W′_bal reaches zero). Notably,
this linear usage holds during intermittent work bouts as well – each hard interval draws down the W′
reserve by the area under the curve above CP.
W′ recovery:  When power drops back below CP  (during a recovery interval or a respite in pacing), the
remaining W′ can refill, but not linearly  – it follows a curvilinear (exponential)  time course . Early
in recovery, W′ regenerates quickly, then the rate of recharge slows as it asymptotically approaches the
original W′ level. In other words, W′ recovery behaves like a first-order  exponential process  with a
certain  time  constant .  Crucially,  the  speed  of  W′  reconstitution  depends  on  how  easy  the
recovery is: the farther below CP  the recovery intensity is, the faster W′ recovers . For instance,
one study found the recovery time constant τ was ~377 seconds when recovering at a very low 20 W,
around 452 s at moderate-intensity recovery, and as slow as ~580 s when “recovering” just below CP in
the heavy domain . If the power never goes below CP at all, W′ cannot recharge  (the model predicts
an infinite τ when recovery power remains above CP, meaning the athlete is still net consuming W′ even
in “recovery”) .
Modeling W′ balance:  Using these principles, a continuous W′_bal model was developed (Skiba et al.
2012, 2015) to track the dynamic state of W′ during variable work rates. In mathematical form, it can be
described piecewise by differential equations. When : 
meaning W′_bal decreases at the rate power exceeds CP (Joules per second). And when :
meaning W′_bal replenishes toward its maximum value with an exponential time constant . Here
 is the athlete’s full W′ capacity (recovered), and   is a constant that may vary with recovery
intensity as noted above. In plain language, after a hard effort, the fraction  of W′ that regenerates per
second depends on how much W′ is “missing” and how quickly the athlete physiologically recovers (fast
at first, then slower). The W′_balance  at any time is essentially: initial W′ minus what’s been used, plus
what’s been regained via exponential recovery. Empirical models confirm that an exponential recharge
function fits observed data well . For example, Ferguson et al. (2010) showed W′ comes back more
rapidly in the first minutes post-exercise than later , evidencing a curvilinear pattern . Skiba and8

colleagues  then  validated  an  integral  W′_bal  model  in  cyclists,  showing  it  could  accurately  predict
exhaustion during varied interval protocols – when the model’s W′_bal hit ~0, the athlete was indeed at
failure . In summary,  W′ is utilized linearly when above CP, but its recovery below CP is
exponential  (non-linear), a behavior that modern W′_bal models take into account .
CP vs. FTP: Physiological Accuracy and Differences
Functional Threshold Power (FTP)  is a concept from cycling training that is often compared to CP. Both
CP and FTP intend to pinpoint an athlete’s threshold between sustainable and unsustainable effort, but
they  are  defined  differently.  CP  is  derived  from  the  power–duration  relationship  using  multiple
exhaustive tests, whereas FTP is typically defined as the highest power one can sustain in a quasi-
steady state for ~60 minutes  (in practice, often estimated as ~95% of a best 20-minute power test).
In essence, CP is a parameter from a physiological model, while FTP is a shorthand performance metric.
Magnitude:  Studies on well-trained cyclists have found that CP and FTP are closely related but  not
interchangeable . In a 2021 study, for example, CP (determined by a 3-test model) averaged 282 W,
while FTP (from a 60-min prediction via a 20-min test) averaged 266 W in the same athletes – CP was
about 16 W (roughly 6%) higher than FTP on average . This was a significant difference, meaning one
cannot assume CP equals FTP for a given individual. Generally, CP tends to be a bit higher than the true
one-hour power for many athletes . Conceptually, CP often corresponds to the upper limit of the
heavy-intensity domain , which some research suggests might be maintainable for ~30–40 minutes
before slow fatigue processes (e.g. VO₂ slow component, lactate drift) intervene . FTP, defined as a
~60-min power , might be slightly lower if an athlete cannot hold CP for a full hour . In other words, CP is
a more precise mathematically-defined threshold, whereas FTP is an empirical estimate of a one-
hour sustainable power .
Physiological basis:  CP has a strong grounding in physiology – it reflects the maximal steady-state
oxidative  energy  supply  and  corresponds  to  the  critical  intensity  above  which  fatigue-related
metabolites (lactate, H^+, P_i, etc.) continually accumulate . FTP, on the other hand, was not
originally derived from lab measures but has been correlated to the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS)
or critical power in many cases. Both CP and FTP assume a “threshold” for metabolic steady-state, but
the accuracy differs . Because CP is obtained via multiple exhaustive efforts and modeling, it accounts
for both aerobic capacity and anaerobic work capacity (W′), giving insight into an individual’s profile. FTP
is easier to test (requiring just a time trial effort) but can be influenced by testing protocol and doesn’t
explicitly  yield  a  W′-like  parameter .  Researchers  note  that  calling  FTP  and  CP  equivalent  “maximal
metabolic steady-states” can be misleading – in the aforementioned study, CP was significantly higher
than FTP while purportedly representing a similar concept . This suggests that athletes might
reach a true physiological steady state at a power a bit below CP (closer to FTP), and CP itself might be
slightly above the sustainable lactate threshold for some. In practice, coaches often treat CP and FTP as
analogous  benchmarks  (both  delineate  the  boundary  of  tolerable  sustainable  intensity),  but  CP  is
considered more precise and individualized , whereas FTP is a convenient approximation for training
zones .
Using W′ Balance in Coaching and Real-Time Training
Prescription
One of the powerful applications of the CP/W′ model is in designing and adjusting interval workouts
to optimally challenge an athlete. A coaching algorithm that knows an athlete’s CP and W′ can use the
W′ balance  (W′_bal) to prescribe interval intensities and durations in real time for maximal effectiveness
. For example, consider an athlete with a W′ of 20 kJ. How many intervals at a given intensity can1920

they handle before exhaustion? W′_bal modeling provides the answer by tracking the remaining W′. A
coach or software can simulate a planned workout and ensure that by the end of the last interval, the
athlete’s W′_bal is nearly drained (e.g. reaches zero or a small reserve), indicating a full utilization of
high-intensity  capacity  without  failing  too  early .  This  takes  the  guesswork  out  of  crafting
intervals like 4×2 minutes vs. 3×3 minutes : since each athlete’s W′ is unique , the ideal interval count and
duration should match their capacity . If intervals are too long or too many, the model will predict
W′_bal hitting zero before  the workout is done – a warning that the athlete would likely not complete the
session. If intervals are too short or recovery too easy, W′_bal might not be sufficiently challenged by
the end.
In real time, such an algorithm (or device feedback) can adjust on the fly.  During a session , if the
athlete’s W′_bal is dropping faster than expected (meaning they are working harder relative to CP than
planned), the system could recommend extending the next recovery interval or reducing the next
interval’s power slightly to avoid premature exhaustion. Conversely, if W′_bal is still high after an interval
(meaning they didn’t go as hard as prescribed), the next interval could be made more intense or longer .
Modern training software and bike computers have started incorporating live W′_bal charts for this
purpose . Seeing a “W′ remaining” metric (sometimes visualized like a battery of matches left to
burn) gives athletes and coaches actionable insight – for instance, a cyclist in a race might decide
whether it’s safe to attack  based on how much W′ they have left in the tank . From a coaching
perspective, the precision in interval prescription  is greatly improved. Instead of prescribing generic
interval lengths, a coach can specify, say, repeats at 120% of CP until W′_bal is 20% (nearly exhausted),
then recover until W′_bal is back to 90%, and repeat. This ensures each athlete is stressed appropriately
relative to their individual capacities . As one sports science article summarizes: with knowledge of
an athlete’s CP, W′, and W′ recovery kinetics, a coach can prescribe work and recovery intervals “with
greater precision to achieve specific physiological goals” . 
In summary, the CP and W′ model not only explains the fundamental power–duration relationship
(hyperbolic curve) and defines W′ as a finite reserve of work above threshold, but it also provides
practical tools. W′ balance modeling allows real-time monitoring of an athlete’s high-intensity energy
reserves,  enabling  smarter  interval  training  design  and  pacing  strategies.  By  avoiding  excessive
depletion of W′ too early (or ensuring it’s fully utilized by the end of key workouts), athletes can train
and  compete  more  effectively .  This  integration  of  physiology  and  training  prescription
exemplifies  how  the  CP/W′  concept  bridges  lab  theory  with  on-the-road  (or  on-the-track)  coaching
decisions.
