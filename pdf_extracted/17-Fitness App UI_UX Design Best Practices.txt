Introduction:
 
The
 
Intersection
 
of
 
Biometrics
 
and
 
Interface
 
Design
 
The
 
digital
 
transformation
 
of
 
sports
 
and
 
fitness
 
has
 
evolved
 
from
 
simple
 
activity
 
logging
 
into
 
a
 
sophisticated
 
ecosystem
 
of
 
physiological
 
surveillance,
 
predictive
 
modeling,
 
and
 
behavioral
 
modification.
 
Modern
 
fitness
 
applications
 
are
 
no
 
longer
 
passive
 
repositories
 
for
 
GPS
 
traces
 
and
 
timestamps;
 
they
 
serve
 
as
 
automated
 
coaches,
 
recovery
 
analysts,
 
and
 
health
 
guardians.
 
This
 
shift
 
necessitates
 
a
 
fundamental
 
rethinking
 
of
 
User
 
Interface
 
(UI)
 
and
 
User
 
Experience
 
(UX)
 
design
 
patterns.
 
The
 
challenge
 
for
 
contemporary
 
designers
 
is
 
not
 
merely
 
the
 
accurate
 
rendering
 
of
 
data
 
but
 
the
 
translation
 
of
 
complex
 
algorithmic
 
outputs—such
 
as
 
the
 
Banister
 
Impulse-Response
 
model
 
or
 
Heart
 
Rate
 
Variability
 
(HRV)
 
time-domain
 
analyses—into
 
intuitive
 
visual
 
narratives
 
that
 
guide
 
user
 
behavior
 
without
 
inducing
 
cognitive
 
overload
 
or
 
"metric
 
fixation"
 
anxiety.
1
 
As
 
wearable
 
technology
 
permeates
 
the
 
consumer
 
market,
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
data
 
available
 
for
 
visualization
 
has
 
exploded.
 
Devices
 
now
 
track
 
continuous
 
heart
 
rate,
 
blood
 
oxygen
 
saturation,
 
wrist
 
temperature,
 
and
 
accelerometer-based
 
movement
 
load.
3
 
However,
 
raw
 
data
 
is
 
often
 
unintelligible
 
to
 
the
 
end-user.
 
The
 
success
 
of
 
a
 
fitness
 
application
 
relies
 
on
 
its
 
ability
 
to
 
bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
"External
 
Load"
 
(the
 
work
 
performed,
 
such
 
as
 
watts,
 
pace,
 
or
 
distance)
 
and
 
"Internal
 
Load"
 
(the
 
biological
 
cost,
 
such
 
as
 
heart
 
rate
 
drift,
 
HRV
 
suppression,
 
or
 
Ratings
 
of
 
Perceived
 
Exertion).
1
 
Effective
 
UI/UX
 
design
 
functions
 
as
 
an
 
abstraction
 
layer,
 
converting
 
these
 
raw
 
inputs
 
into
 
actionable
 
insights
 
like
 
"Readiness,"
 
"Form,"
 
or
 
"Body
 
Battery".

provides
 
an
 
exhaustive
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
best
 
practices
 
for

It
 
examines
 
the
 
architectural
 
requirements
 
for
 
rendering
 
the
 
Performance

(PMC)
 
on
 
mobile

for
 
visualizing
 
Training
 
Load
 
and
 
Recovery
 
for
 
non-expert

Furthermore,
 
it
 
details
 
the
 
critical

required
 
to
 
capture
 
baseline
 
physiological
 
data—such
 
as
 
Functional
 
Threshold
 
Power
 
(FTP)
 
and

catalogs
 
the
 
essential
 
Key
 
Performance
 
Indicators
 
(KPIs)
 
that
 
define
 
success
 
in
 
the
 
digital
 
fitness
 
sector.
 
Drawing
 
upon

from
 
industry
 
leaders
 
including
 
TrainingPeaks,
 
Strava,
 
Garmin,
 
Whoop,
 
Oura,

synthesizes
 
a

for
 
the

generation
 
of

The
 
Performance

Chart
 
(PMC):
 
Theoretical
 
Foundations
 
and
 
Visual
 
Architecture
 
The
 
Performance
 
Management
 
Chart
 
(PMC)
 
represents
 
the
 
gold
 
standard
 
for
 
visualizing
 
long-term
 
training
 
adaptations
 
in
 
endurance
 
sports.
 
Originally
 
popularized
 
by
 
the
 
platform
 
TrainingPeaks
 
and
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
scientific
 
principles
 
of
 
the
 
impulse-response
 
model,
 
the
 
PMC
 
is
 
a
 
complex
 
data
 
visualization
 
challenge.
 
It
 
requires
 
the
 
simultaneous
 
display
 
of
 
three
 
interacting
 
datasets
 
over
 
a
 
temporal
 
axis,
 
modeling
 
the
 
athlete's
 
changing
 
physiological
 
state.
 
Designing
 
a
 
mobile-friendly
 
PMC
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
significant
 
challenges
 
in
 
sports
 
UI
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
density
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
and
 
the
 
necessity
 
for
 
precise
 
temporal
 
comparisons.
7
 
2.1
 
Theoretical
 
Underpinnings
 
and
 
Metric
 
Definitions
 
To
 
design
 
an
 
effective
 
PMC
 
interface,
 
one
 
must
 
first
 
understand
 
the
 
underlying
 
metrics.
 
The
 
chart
 
visualizes
 
the
 
interaction
 
between
 
three
 
variables
 
derived
 
from
 
daily
 
Training
 
Stress
 
Scores
 
(TSS):
 
●
 
Fitness
 
(Chronic
 
Training
 
Load
 
-
 
CTL):
 
This
 
metric
 
represents
 
the
 
athlete's
 
long-term
 
training
 
volume
 
and
 
metabolic
 
capacity.
 
It
 
is
 
calculated
 
as
 
an
 
exponentially
 
weighted
 
moving
 
average
 
of
 
daily
 
Training
 
Load,
 
typically
 
over
 
a
 
42-day
 
period.
8
 
In
 
visual
 
design,
 
this
 
line
 
represents
 
stability
 
and
 
slow
 
change.
 
It
 
is
 
the
 
"anchor"
 
of
 
the
 
chart,
 
showing
 
the
 
accumulation
 
of
 
work
 
over
 
months
 
or
 
years.
 
●
 
Fatigue
 
(Acute
 
Training
 
Load
 
-
 
ATL):
 
This
 
metric
 
represents
 
the
 
short-term
 
stress
 
placed
 
on
 
the
 
body.
 
It
 
is
 
typically
 
calculated
 
as
 
a
 
7-day
 
exponentially
 
weighted
 
moving
 
average.
8
 
Unlike
 
Fitness,
 
Fatigue
 
is
 
highly
 
volatile;
 
it
 
spikes
 
immediately
 
following
 
a
 
hard
 
workout
 
and
 
decays
 
rapidly
 
during
 
rest.
 
Visually,
 
this
 
line
 
is
 
characterized
 
by
 
sharp
 
peaks
 
and
 
valleys.
 
●
 
Form
 
(Training
 
Stress
 
Balance
 
-
 
TSB):
 
Form
 
is
 
the
 
mathematical
 
difference
 
between
 
Fitness
 
and
 
Fatigue
 
($TSB
 
=
 
CTL
 
-
 
ATL$).
8
 
It
 
represents
 
the
 
athlete's
 
"readiness"
 
to
 
perform.
 
A
 
highly
 
negative
 
TSB
 
indicates
 
deep
 
fatigue,
 
while
 
a
 
positive
 
TSB
 
indicates
 
freshness
 
(or
 
tapering).
 
The
 
relationship
 
between
 
these
 
three
 
lines
 
tells
 
the
 
story
 
of
 
the
 
athlete's
 
season.
 
A
 
rising
 
Fitness
 
line
 
is
 
desirable,
 
but
 
it
 
inevitably
 
drives
 
the
 
Fatigue
 
line
 
up
 
and
 
the
 
Form
 
line
 
down.
 
The
 
UI
 
must
 
clearly
 
articulate
 
this
 
trade-off,
 
helping
 
users
 
understand
 
that
 
they
 
cannot
 
build
 
fitness
 
without
 
incurring
 
fatigue.

2.2
 
Visual
 
Hierarchy
 
and
 
Color
 
Coding
 
The
 
cognitive
 
load
 
of
 
interpreting
 
three
 
intersecting
 
lines
 
is
 
high.
 
Successful
 
designs
 
employ
 
strict
 
color-coding
 
conventions
 
to
 
aid
 
distinguishability.
 
While
 
TrainingPeaks
 
established
 
the
 
standard
 
palette,
 
variations
 
exist
 
across
 
platforms.

8
 
A
 
critical
 
design
 
pattern
 
in
 
modern
 
PMC
 
implementations
 
is
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
Zone
 
Visualization
 
for
 
the
 
Form
 
(TSB)
 
metric.
 
Since
 
TSB
 
dictates
 
readiness,
 
simply
 
plotting
 
a
 
line
 
is
 
insufficient
 
for
 
non-experts.
 
The
 
background
 
of
 
the
 
chart
 
or
 
the
 
fill
 
of
 
the
 
Form
 
area
 
should
 
be
 
color-banded
 
to
 
indicate
 
physiological
 
states:
 
●
 
High
 
Risk
 
(Red
 
Zone):
 
TSB
 
values
 
below
 
-30.
 
This
 
indicates
 
an
 
Acute
 
Chronic
 
Workload
 
Ratio
 
(ACWR)
 
that
 
is
 
dangerous,
 
signaling
 
a
 
high
 
risk
 
of
 
injury
 
or
 
illness.
10
 
●
 
Optimal
 
Training
 
(Green
 
Zone):
 
TSB
 
values
 
between
 
-10
 
and
 
-30.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
"sweet
 
spot"
 
for
 
progressive
 
overload,
 
where
 
the
 
athlete
 
is
 
stressing
 
the
 
system
 
enough
 
to
 
elicit
 
adaptation
 
but
 
not
 
enough
 
to
 
break
 
it.
10
 
●
 
Freshness/Taper
 
(Grey/Blue
 
Zone):
 
TSB
 
values
 
above
 
+5.
 
This
 
indicates
 
the
 
athlete
 
is
 
shedding
 
fatigue,
 
ideally
 
before
 
a
 
race.
 
However,
 
prolonged
 
time
 
in
 
this
 
zone
 
indicates
 
detraining.

Mobile
 
Layout
 
Challenges
 
and
 
Interaction
 
Patterns
 
Rendering
 
a
 
PMC
 
on
 
a
 
mobile
 
device
 
presents
 
severe
 
spatial
 
constraints.
 
A
 
desktop
 
PMC
 
might
 
span
 
a
 
12-month
 
season,
 
allowing
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
"staircase"
 
effect
 
of
 
periodized
 
training
 
blocks.
12
 
On
 
a
 
mobile
 
screen,
 
compressing
 
365
 
data
 
points
 
into
 
300
 
pixels
 
of
 
width
 
results
 
in
 
an
 
illegible
 
"spaghetti
 
plot."
 
2.3.1
 
Temporal
 
Segmentation
 
and
 
Default
 
Views
 
Best
 
practices
 
for
 
mobile
 
PMC
 
design
 
involve
 
intelligent
 
temporal
 
segmentation.
 
The
 
default
 
view
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
"All
 
Time"
 
or
 
"Year
 
to
 
Date,"
 
but
 
rather
 
a
 
trailing
 
90-day
 
window
.
 
This
 
timeframe
 
provides
 
sufficient
 
context
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
immediate
 
trend
 
(e.g.,
 
"Is
 
my
 
fitness
 
rising
 
or
 

---PAGE---

falling?")
 
without
 
compressing
 
the
 
daily
 
variance
 
of
 
the
 
Fatigue
 
line.
15
 
To
 
accommodate
 
longer-term
 
analysis,
 
the
 
interface
 
must
 
support
 
fluid
 
pinch-to-zoom
 
interactions
 
on
 
the
 
x-axis.
 
As
 
the
 
user
 
pinches
 
out,
 
the
 
granularity
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
aggregation
 
should
 
shift
 
dynamically.
 
At
 
the
 
widest
 
zoom
 
(Year
 
view),
 
the
 
chart
 
might
 
smooth
 
the
 
Fatigue
 
spikes
 
to
 
show
 
general
 
trends.
 
At
 
the
 
tightest
 
zoom
 
(Month/Week
 
view),
 
the
 
chart
 
should
 
reveal
 
individual
 
daily
 
stressors.
11
 
2.3.2
 
The
 
"Scrubbing"
 
Interaction
 
Model
 
Static
 
charts
 
are
 
insufficient
 
for
 
analysis.
 
Users
 
need
 
to
 
correlate
 
specific
 
calendar
 
dates
 
(e.g.,
 
"The
 
day
 
of
 
the
 
Marathon")
 
with
 
their
 
physiological
 
metrics.
 
The
 
essential
 
interaction
 
pattern
 
is
 
the
 
vertical
 
scrub
 
bar
 
(or
 
reticle).
 
●
 
Interaction:
 
As
 
the
 
user
 
drags
 
a
 
finger
 
across
 
the
 
chart,
 
a
 
vertical
 
line
 
snaps
 
to
 
the
 
nearest
 
day.
 
●
 
Data
 
Feedback:
 
A
 
floating
 
tooltip
 
or
 
a
 
sticky
 
header
 
must
 
instantly
 
update
 
to
 
show
 
the
 
precise
 
numerical
 
values
 
for
 
CTL,
 
ATL,
 
and
 
TSB
 
for
 
the
 
selected
 
date.
12
 
●
 
Contextual
 
Overlay:
 
Crucially,
 
the
 
scrub
 
interaction
 
should
 
also
 
highlight
 
the
 
actual
 
workout
 
performed
 
on
 
that
 
day.
 
A
 
summary
 
card
 
at
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
screen
 
should
 
display
 
the
 
workout
 
details
 
(e.g.,
 
"Long
 
Run:
 
20km")
 
corresponding
 
to
 
the
 
chart
 
position.
 
This
 
reinforces
 
the
 
cause-and-effect
 
link:
 
"I
 
did
 
a
 
long
 
run
 
(Card),
 
therefore
 
my
 
Fatigue
 
spiked
 
(Chart)".
12
 
2.3.3
 
Dual-Axis
 
vs.
 
Stacked
 
Charting
 
A
 
major
 
point
 
of
 
divergence
 
in
 
design
 
is
 
how
 
to
 
handle
 
the
 
different
 
scales
 
of
 
the
 
metrics.
 
Fitness
 
(CTL)
 
might
 
rise
 
to
 
100+,
 
while
 
Form
 
(TSB)
 
oscillates
 
around
 
0.
 
●
 
Dual-Axis
 
Overlay:
 
Placing
 
CTL
 
on
 
the
 
left
 
axis
 
and
 
TSB
 
on
 
the
 
right
 
axis
 
is
 
common
 
but
 
cognitively
 
taxing.
 
It
 
creates
 
visual
 
clutter
 
where
 
lines
 
cross
 
without
 
intersecting
 
in
 
meaning.
 
●
 
Stacked
 
Layout
 
(Best
 
Practice):
 
A
 
superior
 
pattern
 
for
 
mobile
 
is
 
the
 
stacked
 
view.
 
The
 
top
 
60%
 
of
 
the
 
container
 
displays
 
the
 
Fitness
 
and
 
Fatigue
 
lines
 
(Load).
 
The
 
bottom
 
40%
 
displays
 
the
 
Form
 
as
 
a
 
bar
 
chart
 
centered
 
on
 
zero
 
(Readiness).
 
This
 
physical
 
separation
 
distinguishes
 
"Input"
 
(What
 
I
 
did)
 
from
 
"Output"
 
(How
 
I
 
am
 
prepared),
 
clarifying
 
the
 
narrative.

Advanced
 
PMC
 
Features:
 
"Humanist"
 
Adjustments
 
While
 
the
 
PMC
 
is
 
mathematically
 
rigorous,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
rigid.
 
Advanced
 
platforms
 
like
 
Intervals.icu
 
have
 
introduced
 
"humanist"
 
variations
 
that
 
improve
 
usability
 
for
 
diverse
 
athlete
 
populations.
 
●
 
Percentage-Based
 
Form:
 
Absolute
 
TSB
 
numbers
 
favor
 
elite
 
athletes.
 
A
 
TSB
 
of
 
-20
 
is
 
a
 
heavy
 
load
 
for
 
a
 
novice
 
(Fitness
 
40)
 
but
 
negligible
 
for
 
a
 
pro
 
(Fitness
 
150).
 
Visualizing
 
Form
 
as
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
Fitness
 
normalizes
 
the
 
data,
 
making
 
the
 
"Red
 
Zone"
 
warnings
 
accurate
 
for
 
all
 
users.

Future
 
Modeling:
 
The
 
PMC
 
should
 
not
 
just
 
look
 
backward.
 
By
 
integrating
 
the
 
user's
 
planned
 
workouts
 
from
 
a
 
calendar,
 
the
 
chart
 
can
 
project
 
the
 
Fitness
 
and
 
Fatigue
 
lines

into
 
the

Post-Workout
 
Analysis:
 
Information
 
Architecture
 
and
 
Hierarchy
 
The
 
Post-Workout
 
Analysis
 
screen
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
frequently
 
visited
 
screen
 
in
 
any
 
fitness
 
application.
 
It
 
serves
 
a
 
dual
 
purpose:
 
emotional
 
validation
 
(the
 
"dopamine
 
hit"
 
of
 
completion)
 
and
 
analytical
 
review.
 
The
 
design
 
must
 
balance
 
these
 
conflicting
 
needs
 
through
 
a
 
rigorous
 
visual
 
hierarchy.
 
3.1
 
Tier

The
 
"Hero"
 
Section
 
(Emotional
 
Validation)
 
The
 
top
 
third
 
of
 
the
 
screen
 
is
 
the
 
"Hero"
 
section.
 
Its
 
primary
 
function
 
is
 
to
 
confirm
 
the
 
effort
 
and
 
facilitate
 
social
 
sharing.
 
●
 
Map
 
Visualization:
 
For
 
outdoor
 
activities,
 
the
 
GPS
 
trace
 
is
 
the
 
centerpiece.
 
Best
 
practices
 
dictate
 
that
 
the
 
map
 
should
 
be
 
interactive,
 
not
 
a
 
static
 
image.
 
The
 
trace
 
line
 
should
 
be
 
poly-line
 
colored
 
to
 
represent
 
data
 
intensity
 
(e.g.,
 
gradient
 
from
 
green
 
to
 
red
 
indicating
 
speed,
 
heart
 
rate,
 
or
 
power).
 
This
 
allows
 
users
 
to
 
instantly
 
identify
 
the
 
"hard
 
parts"
 
of
 
the
 
route
 
without
 
reading
 
a
 
graph.

Primary
 
Triad:
 
Three
 
metrics
 
define
 
the

at
 
a
 
glance:
 
Distance
,
 
Duration
 
(Time),
 
and
 
Pace/Speed/Power
 
(depending
 
on
 
sport).
 
●
 
Media
 
Integration:
 
Photos
 
taken
 
during
 
the

or
 
header,
 
not
 
buried
 
in
 
a
 
sub-menu.
 
Strava’s
 
recent

critique
 
highlights
 
user
 
frustration
 
when
 
photos
 
are
 
hidden
 
or

are
 
a

Humanizing
 
Data:
 
Visualizing
 
Training
 
Load
 
and
 
Recovery
 
for
 
Non-Experts
 
While
 
the
 
PMC
 
is
 
powerful,
 
it
 
is
 
inherently
 
complex
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
intimidating.
 
"Fitness,"
 
"Fatigue,"
 
and
 
"Form"
 
are
 
specialized
 
terms
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
counter-intuitive
 
(e.g.,
 
in
 
PMC
 
theory,
 
high
 
"Fatigue"
 
is
 
a
 
sign
 
of
 
hard
 
work,
 
whereas
 
laypeople
 
view
 
fatigue
 
as
 
negative).
 
To
 
democratize
 
sports
 
data,
 
designers
 
have
 
developed
 
"Humanist"
 
visualization
 
models
 
that
 
use
 
metaphors
 
to
 
guide
 
behavior.
 
4.1
 
The
 
Battery
 
Metaphor
 
(Energy
 
Management)
 
Garmin’s
 
Body
 
Battery
 
is
 
a
 
seminal
 
example
 
of
 
metaphorical
 
data
 
visualization.
 
It
 
simplifies
 
the
 
complex
 
interaction
 
of
 
HRV,
 
stress,
 
sleep,
 
and
 
activity
 
into
 
a
 
single,
 
relatable
 
concept:
 
a
 
smartphone
 
battery.
 
●
 
Visual
 
Semantics:
 
The
 
UI
 
uses
 
a
 
lightning
 
bolt
 
icon
 
and
 
a
 
0-100
 
scale.
 
This
 
leverages
 
a
 
universal
 
mental
 
model:
 
humans,
 
like
 
phones,
 
charge
 
at
 
night
 
and
 
deplete
 
during
 
the
 
day.
5
 
●
 
Graphing
 
Pattern:
 
The
 
primary
 
visualization
 
is
 
a
 
line
 
graph
 
that
 
"charges"
 
(slope
 
goes
 
up)
 
during
 
periods
 
of
 
high
 
HRV
 
(rest/sleep)
 
and
 
"drains"
 
(slope
 
goes
 
down)
 
during
 
periods
 
of
 
low
 
HRV
 
(stress/activity).
 
●
 
Color-Coded
 
States:
 
○
 
Blue
 
(Recharge):
 
Used
 
to
 
highlight
 
periods
 
of
 
recovery
 
(sleep,
 
naps,
 
meditation).
28
 

---PAGE---

○
 
Orange
 
(Stress/Drain):
 
Used
 
to
 
indicate
 
physiological
 
stress.
 
Crucially,
 
the
 
UI
 
distinguishes
 
"Stress"
 
(non-exercise
 
sympathetic
 
activation)
 
from
 
"Activity"
 
(exercise),
 
helping
 
users
 
identify
 
lifestyle
 
stressors
 
(e.g.,
 
alcohol,
 
work
 
anxiety)
 
that
 
drain
 
their
 
battery
 
without
 
providing
 
fitness
 
benefits.
29
 
4.2
 
The
 
Path
 
Metaphor
 
(Sustainable
 
Consistency)
 
Gentler
 
Streak
 
and
 
Athlytic
 
employ
 
a
 
"Target
 
Range"
 
or
 
"Path"
 
metaphor,
 
which
 
prioritizes
 
consistency
 
over
 
accumulation.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
direct
 
response
 
to
 
the
 
"closure
 
anxiety"
 
caused
 
by
 
ring-based
 
interfaces
 
that
 
demand
 
daily
 
activity
 
regardless
 
of
 
recovery
 
status.
 
●
 
Gentler
 
Streak’s
 
"Activity
 
Path":
 
Instead
 
of
 
a
 
linear
 
graph
 
that
 
must
 
always
 
ascend,
 
this
 
UI
 
presents
 
a
 
green
 
band
 
or
 
"path"
 
flowing
 
horizontally
 
across
 
the
 
screen.
 
The
 
user's
 
daily
 
load
 
is
 
represented
 
as
 
a
 
dot.
 
○
 
The
 
Goal:
 
Keep
 
the
 
dot
 
inside
 
the
 
path.
 
○
 
Nuance:
 
The
 
path
 
moves
 
up
 
and
 
down
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
user's
 
baseline
 
fitness.
 
If
 
the
 
user
 
trains
 
too
 
hard,
 
the
 
dot
 
shoots
 
above
 
the
 
path
 
into
 
a
 
yellow/red
 
"Overreaching"
 
zone.
 
If
 
they
 
are
 
inactive,
 
it
 
drops
 
below
 
into
 
a
 
"De-training"
 
zone.
3
 
○
 
Why
 
it
 
works:
 
It
 
visually
 
legitimizes
 
rest.
 
A
 
rest
 
day
 
keeps
 
the
 
dot
 
in
 
the
 
optimal
 
zone,
 
whereas
 
in
 
a
 
cumulative
 
graph
 
(like
 
Strava’s
 
weekly
 
volume),
 
a
 
rest
 
day
 
looks
 
like
 
a
 
"zero"
 
or
 
a
 
failure.
 
●
 
Athlytic’s
 
"Target
 
Exertion":
 
This
 
interface
 
presents
 
a
 
daily
 
target
 
range
 
(e.g.,
 
4.0
 
-
 
7.0
 
Exertion)
 
calculated
 
from
 
the
 
morning's
 
recovery
 
metrics.
 
The
 
UI
 
visually
 
"unlocks"
 
higher
 
intensity
 
zones
 
only
 
when
 
recovery
 
is
 
sufficient.
 
If
 
recovery
 
is
 
low,
 
the
 
target
 
range
 
shrinks,
 
guiding
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
limit
 
intensity.
32
 
4.3
 
The
 
Ring
 
and
 
Crown
 
Metaphors
 
(Gamification
 
of
 
Rest)
 
Oura
 
and
 
Apple
 
utilize
 
circular
 
visualizations
 
to
 
denote
 
completeness.
 
●
 
Oura’s
 
Readiness
 
Crown:
 
Oura
 
gamifies
 
recovery
 
by
 
awarding
 
a
 
"Crown"
 
icon
 
when
 
the
 
Readiness,
 
Sleep,
 
or
 
Activity
 
score
 
exceeds
 
85.
 
This
 
provides
 
a
 
positive
 
reinforcement
 
loop
 
for
 
passive
 
behaviors
 
(sleeping
 
well),
 
which
 
is
 
rare
 
in
 
the
 
fitness
 
industry.
6
 
●
 
Apple’s
 
Rings:
 
While
 
primarily
 
activity-focused,
 
the
 
visual
 
satisfaction
 
of
 
"closing
 
the
 
ring"
 
(the
 
particle
 
effects,
 
the
 
haptic
 
thud)
 
creates
 
a
 
powerful
 
dopamine
 
response
 
loop.
 
The
 
challenge
 
for
 
designers
 
is
 
to
 
apply
 
this
 
same
 
satisfying
 
feedback
 
loop
 
to
 
recovery
 
metrics,
 
celebrating
 
a
 
"Rest

closed
 
as
 
enthusiastically
 
as

If
 
a
 
user

Onboarding
 
Flows:
 
Capturing
 
Baseline
 
Metrics
 
and
 
Physiology
 
A
 
sports
 
data
 
application
 
is
 
functionally
 
useless
 
without
 
accurate
 
baseline
 
data.
 
If
 
the
 
system
 
does
 
not
 
know
 
the
 
user's
 
Maximum
 
Heart
 
Rate,
 
Functional
 
Threshold
 
Power
 
(FTP),
 
or
 
Resting
 
Heart
 
Rate,
 
every
 
subsequent
 
calculation—from
 
Calorie
 
Burn
 
to
 
Training
 
Stress
 
Balance—will
 
be
 
flawed.
7
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
onboarding
 
flow
 
is
 
not
 
merely
 
a
 
tutorial;
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
data-acquisition
 
phase.
 
5.1
 
The
 
"Calibration"
 
Phase
 
Modern
 
best
 
practices
 
are
 
moving
 
away
 
from
 
asking
 
users
 
to
 
"guess"
 
their
 
metrics
 
during
 
signup.
 
Instead,
 
apps
 
are
 
designing
 
a
 
Calibration
 
Period
 
(typically
 
4-7
 
days)
 
where
 
the
 
app
 
gathers
 
data
 
before
 
providing
 
insights.
 
●
 
UI
 
Pattern:
 
A
 
progress
 
bar
 
or
 
"Calibration
 
Status"
 
ring
 
on
 
the
 
home
 
screen
 
that
 
fills
 
up
 
over
 
the
 
first

This
 
manages
 
user
 
expectations
 
for
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
immediate

Zwift,
 
TrainerRoad,
 
or
 
Peloton),
 
capturing
 
the
 
Functional
 
Threshold
 
Power
 
(FTP)
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
setting
 
training
 
zones.
 
The
 
traditional
 
20-minute
 
FTP
 
test
 
is
 
notoriously
 
grueling
 
and
 
suffers
 
from
 
pacing
 
errors.
 
The

In-Test
 
UI:
 
A
 
simplified,
 
high-contrast
 
screen.
 
Remove
 
all
 
extraneous
 
data.
 
Show
 
only:

○
 
Target
 
Power:
 
The
 
current
 
step
 
wattage.
 
○
 
Step
 
Timer:
 
A
 
countdown
 
for
 
the
 
current

○
 
Cadence:
 
To
 
ensure
 
they
 
keep
 
pedaling.

Do
 
not
 
show
 
the
 
predicted
 
FTP
 
or
 
the
 
remaining

(as
 
it
 
is
 
open-ended).
 
3.
 
The
 
"Failure"
 
Interaction:
 
As
 
the
 
user
 
reaches
 
max
 
exertion,
 
their
 
fine
 
motor
 
skills
 
and
 
vision
 
are
 
compromised.
 
The
 
mechanism
 
to
 
end
 
the
 
test
 
must
 
be
 
foolproof.
 
○
 
Auto-Detection:
 
Ideally,
 
the
 
system
 
detects
 
when
 
power
 
drops
 
below
 
the
 
target
 
for
 
X
 
seconds
 
and
 
auto-ends
 
the
 
test.

Manual
 
Override:
 
A
 
massive,
 
red
 
"I'm

tappable
 
with
 
a
 
trembling
 
hand.

Result
 
Acceptance:
 
Immediately
 
upon
 
completion,
 
display
 
the
 
calculated
 
FTP.
 
Crucially,
 
the
 
UI
 
must
 
explain
 
the
 
implication
 
of
 
this
 
number:
 
"Your
 
FTP
 
is
 
250W.
 
We
 
have
 
updated
 
your
 
training
 
zones.
 
Your
 
endurance
 
rides
 
will
 
now
 
target
 
140-165W."
 
This
 
connects
 
the
 
painful
 
test
 
to
 
future
 
value.

Hardware
 
Integration
 
and
 
Pairing
 
Flows
 
Friction
 
in
 
pairing
 
external
 
sensors
 
(Heart
 
Rate
 
Monitors,
 
Power
 
Meters,
 
Smart
 
Trainers)
 
is
 
a
 
primary
 
cause
 
of
 
churn
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
session.
 
The
 
"Sensor
 
Discovery"
 
UI
 
must
 
be
 
robust.
 
●
 
Visualizing
 
Signals:
 
Do
 
not
 
just
 
list
 
device
 
names
 
(e.g.,
 
"HRM-Dual
 
4839").
 
Display
 
the
 
device
 
type
 
icon,
 
the
 
signal
 
strength
 
(RSSI)
 
bars,
 
and—most
 
importantly—the
 
live
 
data
 
preview
 
(e.g.,
 
"65
 
bpm").
 
This
 
confirms
 
to
 
the
 
user
 
that
 
the
 
device
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
"connected"
 
but
 
actually
 
"working".
41
 
●
 
Troubleshooting
 
Guidance:
 
If
 
a
 
sensor
 
fails
 
to
 
pair
 
or
 
drops
 
signal,
 
the
 
UI
 
must
 
provide
 
specific,
 
illustrated
 
troubleshooting.
 
"No
 
Heart
 
Rate
 
detected?
 
Try
 
moistening
 
the
 
strap
 
electrodes"
 
or
 
"Spin
 
the
 
cranks
 
to
 
wake
 
up
 
the
 
power
 
meter."
 
Generic
 
error
 
messages
 
("Connection
 
Failed")
 
are
 
unacceptable
 
in
 
this
 
domain.
 
5.4
 
Baseline
 
Bio-Data
 
Survey
 
To
 
calculate
 
"Internal
 
Load"
 
without
 
sensors,
 
or
 
to
 
refine
 
algorithms,
 
apps
 
need
 
subjective
 
and
 
objective
 
bio-data.
 
●
 
Demographics:
 
Gender,
 
Age,
 
and
 
Weight
 
are
 
non-negotiable
 
for
 
calorie
 
and
 
zone
 
estimation.
 
●
 
Resting
 
Heart
 
Rate
 
(RHR)
 
Measurement:
 
If
 
the
 
user
 
lacks
 
a
 
wearable,
 
the
 
app
 
should
 
include
 
a
 
flow
 
to
 
measure
 
RHR
 
using
 
the
 
phone’s
 
camera
 
and
 
flash
 
(PPG).
 
The
 
UI
 
guides
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
place
 
their
 
finger
 
on
 
the
 
lens
 
and
 
visualizes
 
the
 
pulse
 
wave
 
in
 
real-time,
 
building
 
trust
 
in
 
the
 
measurement.
42
 
●
 
Goal
 
Setting:
 
The
 
onboarding
 
must
 
ask
 
the
 
user's
 
primary
 
motivation:
 
"Weight
 
Loss,"
 
"Performance/Competition,"
 
or
 
"General
 
Health."
 
○
 
Dynamic
 
UI
 
Adaptation:
 
This
 
choice
 
should
 
fundamentally
 
alter
 
the
 
dashboard
 
layout.
 
A
 
"Weight
 
Loss"
 
user
 
should
 
see
 
Calories
 
and
 
Active
 
Minutes
 
prominently.
 
A
 
"Performance"
 
user
 
should
 
see
 
TSS,
 
Power,
 
and
 
PMC
 
charts.
 
Customizing
 
the
 
UI

based
 
on
 
this

Mobile
 
Interaction
 
Patterns
 
for
 
Complex
 
Data
 
Designing
 
for
 
mobile
 
requires
 
managing
 
the
 
tension
 
between
 
the
 
high
 
density
 
of
 
sports
 
data
 
and
 
the
 
limited
 
screen
 
real
 
estate.
 
6.1
 
Landscape
 
vs.
 
Portrait
 
Modalities
 
Complex
 
charts
 
like
 
the
 
PMC
 
or
 
detailed
 
Interval
 
Analysis
 
are
 
often
 
illegible
 
in
 
Portrait
 
mode.
 
●
 
Auto-Rotation:
 
The
 
UI
 
should
 
support
 
landscape
 
rotation
 
for
 
all
 
detailed
 
charts.
 
●
 
Distinct
 
Layouts:
 
In
 
Portrait,
 
show
 
the
 
high-level
 
summary
 
(The
 
"Hero"
 
number).
 
In
 
Landscape,
 
reveal
 
the
 
detailed
 
x/y
 
axis
 
and
 
the
 
full
 
temporal
 
history.
 
This
 
uses
 
the
 
physical
 
orientation
 
of
 
the
 
device
 
as
 
a
 
"zoom"
 
interaction.
11
 
6.2
 
The
 
Tooltip
 
and
 
"Sticky"
 
Header
 
When
 
scrubbing
 
through
 
a
 
chart
 
(e.g.,
 
Heart
 
Rate
 
over
 
a
 
2-hour
 
run),
 
the
 
user's
 
finger
 
often
 
obscures
 
the
 
data
 
point
 
they
 
are
 
trying
 
to
 
read.
 
●
 
Design
 
Pattern:
 
Use
 
a
 
Sticky
 
Header
 
or
 
a
 
Floating
 
Tooltip
 
that
 
appears
 
above
 
the
 
chart
 
area.
 
As
 
the
 
finger
 
scrubs
 
horizontally,
 
the
 
data
 
values
 
in
 
the
 
header
 
update.
 
This
 
ensures
 
legibility
 
is
 
never
 
blocked.
 
●
 
Cross-Hairs:
 
A
 
vertical
 
line
 
(time)
 
and
 
horizontal
 
line
 
(value)
 
should
 
extend
 
from
 
the
 
touch
 
point
 
to
 
the
 
axes,
 
allowing
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
read
 
the
 
exact
 
values
 
on
 
the
 
scales.
45
 
6.3
 
Accessibility
 
and
 
Color
 
Vision
 
Deficiency
 
(CVD)
 
Sports
 
data
 
often
 
relies
 
heavily
 
on
 
Red/Green
 
color
 
coding
 
(Red
 
=
 
High
 
Heart
 
Rate,
 
Green
 
=
 
Low).
 
This
 
is
 
hostile
 
to
 
users
 
with
 
Protanopia
 
or
 
Deuteranopia.
 
●
 
Pattern
 
Fills:
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
color,
 
use
 
pattern
 
fills
 
(e.g.,
 
hatched
 
lines
 
for
 
"Anaerobic
 
Zone,"
 
dots
 
for
 
"Aerobic
 
Zone")
 
in
 
bar
 
charts
 
and
 
area
 
graphs.
 
●
 
Text
 
Labels:
 
Always
 
include
 
text
 
labels
 
alongside
 
color
 
indicators.
 
Do
 
not
 
rely
 
on
 
a
 
green
 
dot
 
to
 
signify
 
"Go."
 
Use
 
a
 
green
 
dot
 
and
 
the
 
text
 
"Ready
 
to
 
Train."
 
●
 
Theme
 
Support:
 
Support
 
for
 
System
 
Dark
 
Mode
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
fitness
 
apps,
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
often
 
used
 
in
 
low-light
 
environments
 
(early
 
morning
 
runs,
 
spinning
 
studios).

(KPIs)
 
for
 
Fitness
 
Applications
 
Measuring
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
a
 
sports
 
data
 
application
 
requires
 
a
 
blend
 
of
 
standard
 
SaaS
 
metrics
 
(Business
 
KPIs)
 
and
 
domain-specific
 
physiological
 
metrics
 
(User
 
Success
 
KPIs).
 
The
 
latter
 
are
 
unique
 
to
 
this
 
industry:
 
if
 
the
 
user
 
does
 
not
 
get
 
fitter,
 
they
 
will
 
eventually
 
churn.

Fitness
 
(Chronic
 
Training
 
Load).
 
A
 
safe
 
ramp
 
is
 
5-8
 
points/week.
 
Apps
 
should
 
monitor
 
this
 
to

Hardware
 
Attachment
 
Rate
 
The
 
%
 
of

Power
 
Meter).
 
Users
 
with
 
connected
 
hardware
 
have
 
significantly
 
higher
 
retention
 
(LTV)
 
because
 
the

is
 
the
 
strongest

indicates
 
that
 
the
 
training
 
plans
 
are
 
appropriately
 
calibrated
 
to
 
the
 
user's
 
ability.
 
Low

Conclusion
 
The
 
design
 
of
 
sports
 
data
 
visualization
 
is
 
moving
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
"data
 
dump"
 
era
 
towards
 
an
 
era
 
of
 
"empathetic
 
intelligence."
 
The
 
most
 
successful
 
applications—those
 
achieving
 
high
 
retention
 
and
 
genuine
 
physiological
 
impact—are
 
those
 
that
 
successfully
 
abstract
 
complex
 
mathematical
 
models
 
(like
 
Banister’s
 
Impulse-Response)
 
into
 
simple,
 
actionable
 
metaphors
 
(Batteries,
 
Paths,
 
Rings).
 
Key
 
takeaways
 
for
 
the
 
architectural
 
design
 
of
 
future
 
sports
 
applications
 
include:
 
1.
 
Prioritize
 
the
 
PMC:
 
It
 
is
 
the
 
engine
 
of
 
insight,
 
but
 
it
 
must
 
be
 
rendered
 
with
 
mobile-first
 
interactions
 
(scrubbing,
 
stacking,
 
zooming)
 
to
 
be
 
legible.
 
2.
 
Humanize
 
Recovery:
 
Move
 
beyond
 
"closing
 
rings."
 
Use
 
metaphors
 
that
 
validate
 
rest
 
as
 
an
 
active
 
and
 
productive
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
cycle.
 
3.
 
Onboard
 
with
 
Rigor:
 
Use
 
the
 
onboarding
 
flow
 
to
 
capture
 
accurate
 
baseline
 
data
 
(FTP,
 
Max
 
HR)
 
via
 
guided
 
calibration
 
tests.
 
Without
 
this,
 
the
 
fancy
 
visualizations
 
are
 
meaningless.
 
4.
 
Contextualize
 
the
 
Post-Workout:
 
Never
 
show
 
a
 
number
 
without
 
context.
 
Is
 
this
 
150bpm
 
high
 
or
 
low
 
for
 
me
?
 
Is
 
this
 
pace
 
faster
 
than
 
my
 
30-day
 
average
?
 
By
 
adhering
 
to
 
these
 
principles,
 
designers
 
can
 
create
 
tools
 
that
 
do
 
not
 
merely
 
document
 
the
 
user's
 
fitness
 
journey
 
but
 
actively
 
guide
 
and
 
enhance
 
it,
 
transforming
 
the
 
mobile
 
device
 
from
 
a
 
passive
 
tracker
 
into
 
a
 
true
 
partner
 
in
 
human
 
performance.
