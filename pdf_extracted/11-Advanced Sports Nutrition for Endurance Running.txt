Advanced Sports Nutrition for Endurance
Running
Introduction
Endurance  running  —  whether  training  for  a  5K  or  competing  in  an  ultra-marathon  —  places
exceptional demands on the human body. Proper nutrition is critical not only for performance during
the race but also for optimizing training adaptations and recovery. Advanced sports nutrition strategies
help runners fuel effectively, stay hydrated, and recover quickly, all while maintaining health. This guide
will  delve  into  cutting-edge  nutritional  approaches  tailored  to  endurance  athletes,  focusing  on
carbohydrate fueling during races, periodized nutrition strategies in training, hydration and electrolyte
management,  and  the  crucial  post-exercise  recovery  window.  Both  amateur  runners  and  semi-
professionals will find practical advice balanced with scientific explanations to enhance their training
and racing outcomes. Throughout this guide, we will emphasize the importance of macronutrients
(carbohydrates, fats, proteins), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and strategic use of supplements
rather than strict meal plans, so you can adapt the principles to your own dietary preferences and
needs.
1. Intra-Race Oxidation Rates
During  prolonged  running  events,  the  body  relies  heavily  on  carbohydrates  as  a  fast-burning  fuel
source, especially at higher intensities. However , the gut can only absorb and oxidize a limited amount
of carbohydrate per hour . Understanding how the body processes different types of sugars can help
runners maximize their energy intake during a race without causing gastrointestinal distress. In this
section, we explore the absorption limits of glucose and fructose via their specific transporters (SGLT1
and GLUT5), the science behind the often-cited guideline of consuming ~90 grams of carbohydrate per
hour  in  ultra-endurance  events,  and  how  “gut  training”  can  improve  an  athlete’s  carbohydrate
absorption and tolerance.
1.1 Glucose vs. Fructose Absorption Limits (SGLT1 vs. GLUT5)
The human intestine has specialized transport proteins for absorbing different sugars:
SGLT1 (Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1):  This transporter is responsible for the uptake of
glucose (and galactose) along with sodium in the small intestine. It has a high capacity but can
become saturated when large amounts of glucose are present. Research has shown that the
maximal absorption and oxidation rate for glucose alone (through SGLT1) is around 60 grams
per hour . In other words, if a runner consumes only glucose-based carbohydrates (such as
maltodextrin or glucose), the body can utilize roughly 1.0–1.1 grams of glucose per minute at
most before any excess remains in the gut. Consuming much more than about 60 g/hour of pure
glucose  typically  does  not  translate  into  higher  energy  availability;  instead  it  can  lead  to
gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort because unabsorbed sugars linger in the intestines and draw
water (via osmotic effect).•

GLUT5 (Glucose Transporter 5):  GLUT5 is the primary transporter for fructose in the small
intestine.  Fructose  absorption  occurs  through  this  separate  pathway  that  does  not  rely  on
sodium. However , its capacity is more limited. Fructose alone can typically be absorbed and
utilized at around 25–30 grams per hour  at most. High intakes of fructose by itself often cause
GI issues (like diarrhea or cramping) because unabsorbed fructose can ferment in the colon and
draw water into the gut.
Importantly, because glucose and fructose use  separate transporter systems  (SGLT1 for glucose,
GLUT5  for  fructose),  an  athlete  can  consume  a  combination  of  these  sugars  to  increase  total
carbohydrate  absorption  beyond  what  either  sugar  could  achieve  alone.  By  using  both  transport
pathways in parallel, the gut can absorb a higher combined amount of carbohydrates per hour than if
only one type of sugar is consumed. This dual-pathway uptake is the foundation for modern sports
nutrition strategies that use mixed carbohydrate sources to maximize energy delivery.
1.2 The “90 g/hour” Rule and Multiple Transportable Carbohydrates (2:1
Glucose:Fructose)
Endurance athletes often hear that they should aim for about 90 grams of carbohydrate per hour  during
ultra-endurance events or very long training sessions. This recommendation stems from studies on
exogenous carbohydrate oxidation that found around  90 g/hour  to be the upper limit of what most
individuals can efficiently oxidize when using a mix of glucose and fructose. Consuming much more
than ~90 g/h tends to provide diminishing returns or cause GI distress in many people, although some
elite athletes who have trained their gut can push these numbers slightly higher (even up to ~100–110
g/h) with careful practice.
Why ~90 g/hour? The number roughly comes from adding the maximum uptake of glucose (~60 g/h via
SGLT1) plus the maximum uptake of fructose (~30 g/h via GLUT5). If a runner ingests glucose and
fructose  in  an  optimal  ratio,  typically  around  2:1  (glucose:fructose) ,  they  can  leverage  both
transporters effectively. For example, a common strategy is to consume ~60 grams of glucose (from
sources like maltodextrin or glucose syrup) plus ~30 grams of fructose per hour . In practice, many
sports gels, drinks, or energy chews are formulated with about a 2:1 ratio of maltodextrin (a glucose
polymer) to fructose.
The 2:1 ratio is critical because:
Glucose is the primary fuel for high-intensity exercise:  It is readily oxidized and supports
anaerobic metabolism when needed. But its absorption plateaus around 60 g/h via SGLT1.
Fructose can bypass the saturated glucose pathway:  Adding fructose allows the athlete to
utilize an additional fuel source by tapping into GLUT5 transporters. Fructose is converted in the
liver to glucose or lactate before being used by muscles, providing an extra energy stream.
Avoiding overload of one transporter:  If an athlete were to try consuming 90 g/h of glucose
alone, much of that beyond 60 g would remain unabsorbed, increasing the risk of GI upset.
Similarly, 90 g of pure fructose would overwhelm GLUT5 and likely cause severe stomach
problems. But ~60 g glucose + ~30 g fructose divides the load between two systems, making
high carbohydrate delivery achievable with lower risk of digestive issues.
Optimal oxidation rates:  Studies have demonstrated that a glucose+fructose mixture can
achieve peak exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates on the order of ~1.3 to 1.5 grams per
minute, whereas glucose-only fueling typically maxes out around ~1.0 g/min. Over the course of
an hour , that difference is significant (e.g., ~90 g vs ~60 g oxidized), translating to more energy
available to working muscles.•

It’s worth noting that some recent research and anecdotal reports from elite ultramarathoners suggest
that with rigorous gut training (discussed next) and genetic predispositions, a few athletes manage
intakes of ~100–120 g/hour using ratios slightly higher in fructose (closer to 1:0.8 glucose:fructose).
However , such high amounts require careful adaptation  and are not tolerated by most people. For the
majority of runners, 60–90 g/h of mixed carbohydrates  is the sweet spot for maximizing energy while
minimizing stomach problems in events lasting more than about 2–3 hours.
1.3 “Gut Training” to Enhance Carbohydrate Absorption and Tolerance
Taking in 60–90 grams of carbohydrate per hour is a substantial amount — for perspective, 90 g is
roughly  equivalent  to  consuming  nearly  four  standard  sports  gels  (~20–25  g  each)  every  hour ,  or
drinking about a liter of a typical sports drink per hour . If an athlete tries to do this suddenly on race day
without prior practice, there’s a high chance they’ll experience cramps, bloating, or diarrhea because
their gastrointestinal system isn’t accustomed to handling that volume of carbs during exercise. This is
where “gut training”  becomes essential.
Gut training refers to the deliberate practice of training the digestive system to handle large quantities
of food or drink during exercise. Just as you train your muscles and cardiovascular system, you can
train your gut  to become more efficient and comfortable with high carbohydrate intake. Key ways gut
training can change the body include:
Increased Transporter Expression:  Regularly consuming high levels of carbohydrates during
training can upregulate the production of intestinal transporters like SGLT1 and GLUT5. The
body adapts by creating more of these gateways in the gut lining, which means over time an
athlete may absorb more glucose and fructose than an untrained gut would. For example, diets
chronically high in carbohydrates have been shown to increase SGLT1 transporter density in the
intestines to improve glucose absorption capacity. By frequently fueling with mixed carbs during
long training sessions, an endurance runner may also induce the gut to express more GLUT5,
potentially  enhancing  fructose  uptake.  In  essence,  practice  eating  carbs  to  teach  your
intestines to absorb carbs better .
Enhanced Gastric Emptying Rate:  The stomach can adapt to larger volumes of fluid and food.
By practicing drinking and eating during runs, the stomach learns to empty its contents more
quickly into the intestine (especially if the nutritional composition is consistent). This means less
sloshing in the stomach and faster delivery of nutrients to where they can be absorbed. Athletes
who never fuel during training often have “untrained” stomachs that might empty slowly or rebel
when suddenly asked to process a big influx of fuel under race stress. Gut training improves the
stomach’s tolerance for volume and its coordination with intestinal absorption.
Reduced Gastrointestinal Distress:  Perhaps the biggest practical benefit is simply teaching the
gut to tolerate the presence of food during exercise. Training on an empty stomach vs. training
with periodic carb intake can feel very different. By repeatedly exposing yourself to consuming
gels, bars, or sports drinks while running, you can discover which products or concentrations
your stomach tolerates best and also condition your digestive system to accept nutrition without
protest. Over time, symptoms like cramping, nausea, or the urgent need for a restroom break
often diminish as your gut adapts to the fueling regimen.
How  to  train  your  gut:  A  typical  gut-training  protocol  might  involve  gradually  increasing  the
carbohydrate intake during select training sessions: - Start by taking in a modest amount, say 20–30 g/
hour , during some easy or long runs. - Each week or two, increase that amount (e.g., 45 g/hour , then 60
g/hour ,  and  so  on)  in  training  sessions.  -  Incorporate  the  types  of  products  you  plan  to  use  in• 
• 
•

---PAGE---

competition (specific gels, sports drink mixes, energy bars) so your system becomes familiar with them.
- Practice not just the amount but also the timing  of intake (e.g., taking smaller , frequent doses every
15–20 minutes vs. larger doses at longer intervals) to see what works best for absorption and comfort.
By the time you reach race day, a well-trained gut will be a competitive advantage: you'll be able to take
in the necessary fuel to keep your energy up, with far less risk of the stomach troubles that plague
many endurance athletes. 
Practical tip:  Treat your GI system as another aspect of fitness to be trained. Don’t wait until race day to
experiment  with  a  90  g/hour  fueling  plan.  For  example,  on  a  few  key  long  runs  leading  up  to  a
marathon or ultra, aim to mimic your race nutrition schedule exactly — same breakfast, same timing of
gels or drink mix, same quantities. This not only trains your gut, but also boosts confidence that your
plan is feasible. If you encounter issues (say, a certain gel flavor triggers nausea at mile 20), you have
time to adjust your strategy well before the race.
2. Periodization of Carbohydrate Intake: “Train Low, Race High”
Beyond fueling during the race itself, endurance athletes can manipulate their day-to-day nutrition to
enhance training adaptations.  Nutrient periodization  refers to adjusting what and when you eat at
different times to meet specific goals. One well-known approach for endurance training is the concept
of “train low, race high.”  In essence, this means training sometimes with low carbohydrate availability
(to stimulate greater fat metabolism and other adaptations) while ensuring you have high carbohydrate
availability  when  it  counts  (e.g.,  during  competitions  or  key  high-intensity  sessions).  This  section
analyzes glycogen depletion protocols used to increase metabolic flexibility and fat oxidation, and
discusses the risks associated with chronically restraining carbohydrates — particularly the condition
known as Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) and other hormonal imbalances from low energy
availability.
2.1 Glycogen-Depletion Training and Enhanced Fat Oxidation (Metabolic Flexibility)
Metabolic flexibility  is the body’s ability to efficiently switch between fuel sources (primarily fats and
carbohydrates) based on availability and the intensity of exercise. Endurance athletes benefit from
being highly metabolically flexible. At moderate intensities and over long durations, a well-trained
athlete will rely more on fat for fuel, preserving limited glycogen (stored carbohydrate in muscles and
liver) for when higher intensities or critical moments arise. This ability to burn a greater proportion of
fat at relatively high intensities is not just a genetic gift — it can be trained and improved through
specific nutritional strategies.
“Training low” usually refers to training with  low glycogen stores  or with low carbohydrate intake
before/during a workout. Athletes employ several methods to do this:
Morning fasted workouts:  Doing a run first thing in the morning without eating carbohydrates
beforehand (after an overnight fast) means you start with somewhat lower liver glycogen and no
immediate glucose supply from food. This forces your body to utilize more fat for fuel. An easy
aerobic run of 60–90 minutes before breakfast is a common example of a fasted workout aimed
at stimulating fat oxidation.
Two-a-day workouts (Sleep Low or Twice-a-Day with Low Carb):  In this strategy, you might do
an evening workout that significantly depletes glycogen (for example, a hard interval run or a
long run), and then deliberately refrain from consuming many carbohydrates  afterward. You• 
•

---PAGE---

go to sleep with your muscles still low on glycogen. Then, the next morning, you perform a
second  training  session  (e.g.,  a  steady  endurance  run)  before  eating  substantial  carbs.  The
second workout is thus done in a glycogen-depleted state. This “sleep low, train low” approach
can amplify the signals for the body to adapt by increasing fat metabolism and mitochondrial
biogenesis.
Low-carb diet blocks:  Some athletes experiment with eating a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet
for several days or weeks during base training to up-regulate fat-burning pathways. This can
increase the capacity to oxidize fat and can even increase the muscle’s ability to store fat as an
energy reserve. However , it often comes at the cost of reduced high-intensity performance and
should usually be done in the off-season or non-competitive phase if attempted. Many will later
reintroduce carbs (or “carb load”) before races (hence “train low, race high”).
Long runs with limited fueling:  Simply not taking any carbohydrate during some long training
sessions  (or  taking  much  less  than  you’re  expending)  can  simulate  late-race  low-glycogen
conditions and force the body to keep going by burning fat. For instance, an athlete might do a
2-3 hour training run with just water or electrolytes, whereas on race day they would consume
carbs  throughout.  This  approach  should  be  used  sparingly  and  only  for  well-conditioned
athletes, as it can be very challenging and increases the risk of hitting the wall in training.
The rationale behind these methods is that when glycogen (carb stores) is low, the body is pushed to
ramp up fat oxidation mechanisms  to compensate. Over time, this results in adaptations such as:
Increased mitochondrial density and oxidative enzymes:  Mitochondria are the “factories” in
muscle  cells  where  aerobic  energy  production  occurs  (burning  fat  or  carbohydrate  in  the
presence  of  oxygen).  Training  in  a  low-glycogen  state  can  trigger  greater  mitochondrial
biogenesis  (creation  of  new  mitochondria)  and  higher  activity  of  enzymes  involved  in  fat
metabolism. This means the muscles become better at using oxygen to burn fuel (especially fat).
Enhanced fat transport and utilization:  The body adapts by making more of the proteins that
transport fatty acids into cells and into mitochondria (e.g., FAT/CD36 transporter , CPT1 enzyme),
and by increasing intramuscular fat stores (so-called IMTG, intramuscular triglycerides, which are
droplets of fat within muscle fibers that can be used for fuel). Essentially, the muscles “learn” to
grab more fat from the bloodstream and also stash a bit more fuel inside for ready use.
Glycogen sparing:  Over time, an athlete who has trained their fat metabolism can maintain a
given submaximal pace while using less glycogen than before, because a larger fraction of the
energy is coming from fat. This can delay the point of glycogen depletion during a race, which is
beneficial for endurance. It’s one reason why seasoned marathoners can often handle 26.2 miles
without “bonking” whereas an untrained person would deplete glycogen much sooner .
Improved  metabolic  health  and  flexibility:  Training  occasionally  in  low-carb  states  can
improve insulin sensitivity and the body’s ability to tolerate carbs when they are consumed (since
the muscle is hungrier for glycogen after a low state). It essentially widens the metabolic range:
you get better at burning fat when fuel is scarce, but you can still take advantage of carbs when
needed.
It is crucial to understand that training low is a tool to enhance specific adaptations, not a way to
perform all the time . In fact, performance during the actual “train low” session will often be impaired•

— you generally can’t push as hard or go as fast when your carb stores are low. This is why coaches
usually periodize this approach carefully:
Only certain sessions (typically longer , lower-intensity ones, or secondary sessions in a day) are
done with low carbs to target fat oxidation.
Key high-intensity workouts and competitions are done “high” – meaning with full glycogen
stores and/or carbohydrate intake – to allow maximum performance and quality. High-intensity
exercise (roughly above 75% VO₂max) relies heavily on carbs, so attempting those sessions on
low fuel can degrade training quality, technique, and increase injury risk.
Scientific studies provide mixed results on whether “train low” protocols improve race performance
directly, but many show clear biochemical changes indicating improved fat metabolism and endurance
capacity. For example, athletes who did fasted training or two-a-day (low glycogen) protocols often
show increases in the enzymes that burn fat and a higher fat-burning rate during exercise, compared to
those who always train with high carbohydrate availability. Performance outcomes, however , may not
improve unless the athlete also maintains some high-quality high-carb training — because you need
both the “engine” (a robust fat-burning aerobic base) and the “turbo” (the ability to use carbs for high-
intensity bursts).
The bottom line for metabolic flexibility: Incorporating some low-glycogen training sessions can teach
your body to use fat more effectively , potentially increasing endurance, but it should be balanced
with  enough  normal/high-carbohydrate  training  to  maintain  the  ability  to  perform  high-intensity
efforts.  It’s  a  fine  balance  to  strike  —  which  leads  into  the  next  important  point  about  potential
downsides if this strategy is overused.
2.2 Risks of Chronic Low-Carb Availability: RED-S and Hormonal Consequences
While strategic low-carb training can be beneficial, doing it too often or not fueling adequately overall
can lead to problems with health and performance. The concept of  Relative Energy Deficiency in
Sport (RED-S)  describes a syndrome where athletes suffer from a range of adverse effects due to
insufficient energy intake relative to their expenditure. Originally, this was recognized as the "Female
Athlete Triad" (energy deficiency leading to menstrual disturbances and bone loss), but the concept has
broadened to include male athletes and many more physiological systems — hence the term RED-S.
Chronic low-carbohydrate availability can contribute to RED-S if it results in  consistently low total
calorie intake  or if the body perceives a state of energy stress. Here’s how overly aggressive carb
restriction or frequent glycogen-depleted training could negatively affect an athlete:
Hormonal disruptions:  The body’s hormonal system is finely tuned to energy balance. If you’re
frequently training hard without adequate carbs or calories, the body increases stress hormones
like cortisol. Over time, chronically elevated cortisol  can have catabolic effects (breaking down
muscle tissue) and suppress immune function. Meanwhile, the production of anabolic (building)
hormones  may  decrease;  for  example,  testosterone  in  males  can  drop  with  low  energy
availability, and in females, estrogen levels can fall, leading to menstrual disturbances such as
irregular periods or amenorrhea (loss of the menstrual cycle). Thyroid hormones also often
decrease  (specifically  T3,  the  active  thyroid  hormone)  as  the  body  tries  to  conserve  energy
during a perceived “famine.” These hormonal shifts are the body’s way of hitting the brakes on
metabolism  to  survive  a  prolonged  deficit,  but  they  are  clearly  detrimental  to  athletic
performance and long-term health.•

---PAGE---

Impaired recovery and adaptation:  Paradoxically, training in a consistently low-carb or low-
energy state can impair the very adaptations you’re trying to achieve. Without sufficient carbs,
you  can’t  train  as  intensely,  which  means  you  might  not  provide  enough  stimulus  for
improvement in speed or power . Additionally, recovery from sessions will be slower if glycogen
stores aren’t being replenished and if protein is being used for energy (due to low carbs) instead
of muscle repair . Over weeks and months, this can lead to stagnation or decline in performance.
You might become a “smaller engine” — able to go long (since you’ve done a lot of slow training),
but overall power and speed decrease.
Loss of muscle mass:  If the body is low on carbohydrates, it may resort to breaking down
protein (from muscles) to produce glucose (through gluconeogenesis) to fuel the brain and vital
functions.  This  means  a  runner  could  lose  lean  muscle  tissue,  which  is  not  desirable  for
performance (muscle power outputs drop, and even for endurance, having some muscle is
important for running economy and preventing injury). Over time, athletes on too low an energy
intake might notice they are losing weight or muscle unintentionally, or not gaining muscle
despite strength training, indicating the body is cannibalizing its own protein.
RED-S  health  consequences:  RED-S  encompasses  not  only  the  immediate  performance
detriments but also broad health issues:
Bone health:  Low energy and low estrogen/testosterone can reduce bone density, increasing
the risk of stress fractures and osteoporosis. Endurance runners are already at risk for stress
fractures from repetitive impact; adding low nutrition makes it worse.
Immune function:  Chronically underfed athletes often get sick more frequently (colds, etc.) or
have trouble recovering from minor illnesses, because the immune system is suppressed.
Metabolic rate:  The body may lower its resting metabolic rate in response to chronic low intake,
which can cause fatigue, difficulty in maintaining body temperature, and other symptoms.
Psychological  effects:  Low  energy  availability  can  also  affect  mood  and  cognitive  function.
Irritability, depression, or decreased ability to concentrate can occur . The training itself feels
harder — running on low fuel can make even an easy run feel like a slog, which can erode
motivation and enjoyment.
RED-S in male vs female athletes:  While originally much focus was on female athletes (with
menstrual irregularities being a clear warning sign), men are also affected by low energy. They
just don’t have a menstrual cycle to give an obvious cue. Instead, signs in men might include
reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, or simply persistent fatigue and poor recovery. In both
genders, low sex hormones  (estrogen or testosterone) due to energy deficiency lead to similar
issues: bone loss, poor muscle gains, mood changes.
In summary,  the key is balance and timing . “Train low, race high” does not mean “train low all the
time.” Most experts advise against adopting a strict low-carb diet chronically for endurance athletes
(unless there is a specific medical or periodized reason, and even then under professional guidance)
because the risks often outweigh the benefits. Instead, consider these guidelines:
Periodize intelligently:  Limit low-carb training to perhaps 1–3 sessions per week, depending on
your experience, and ensure these are spaced out with plenty of normal eating in between. For
instance, you might do a fasted easy run on Wednesday and a sleep-low combo around a
Saturday long run, but ensure the rest of the week you’re fueling normally so you can hit quality
workouts and recover .•

---PAGE---

Refuel when needed:  Even on a day with a low-glycogen session, make sure you eat well after
the session is over . Do not string together multiple days of heavy training with insufficient fuel. If
you do a morning fasted run, have a good breakfast afterward. If you do a late-day hard workout
and "sleep low," make sure to eat a high-quality breakfast before your next intense workout. 
Listen to your body:  If you start experiencing excessive fatigue, insomnia, loss of motivation, or
in the case of women, any menstrual irregularities, take note. These can be early warnings that
you’re not getting enough fuel. It’s better to err on the side of eating a bit more and backing off
training for a few days than to push into full-blown overtraining or RED-S. Remember that
sometimes improving performance means fueling more , not less.
Consult professionals if needed:  If an athlete is considering major dietary changes like low-
carb dieting or if there are signs of RED-S, working with a sports dietitian or physician is wise.
They can help monitor things like iron status (iron deficiency is common in endurance runners
and can be exacerbated by poor diet), vitamin D, hormone levels, etc., and ensure that any
interventions are done safely.
Ultimately, the “train low” concept can be a useful tool in the arsenal of an endurance runner , but it’s a
stress  like  any  other  —  to  be  used  sparingly  and  wisely.  The  payoff  is  a  stronger  fat-burning
metabolism, but the cost of overuse is too high in terms of health and performance detriments. By
balancing  periods  of  low  carbohydrate  availability  with  periods  of  high  carbohydrate  availability
(especially  around  key  workouts  and  races),  athletes  can  get  the  best  of  both  worlds:  enhanced
endurance adaptations and the fuel to perform at their best when it counts.
3. Hydration & Osmolality
Hydration is another pillar of endurance performance that demands careful attention. When running
long  distances  or  in  hot  conditions,  sweat  losses  can  be  substantial,  and  both  dehydration  and
overhydration pose risks to performance and health. But fluid intake is not just about chugging water;
the composition  of that fluid (its electrolyte content and carbohydrate concentration) determines how
effectively  it  hydrates  you.  The  terms  hypotonic,  isotonic,  and  hypertonic  describe  the  relative
concentration of dissolved particles in a fluid compared to human blood, and these properties influence
gastric emptying and fluid absorption rates. Additionally, understanding your individual sweat rate and
sodium  loss  can  guide  a  personalized  hydration  strategy  that  avoids  the  dangerous  pitfall  of
hyponatremia (low blood sodium).
3.1 Hypotonic, Isotonic, and Hypertonic Drinks: Effect on Gastric Emptying
Osmolality  refers to the concentration of solutes (like electrolytes and sugars) in a fluid. Human blood
has an osmolality of roughly ~275 to 295 milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg). For practical purposes,
we can compare sports drinks and fluids to the blood:
A fluid is isotonic  if its solute concentration (tonicity) is similar to that of blood (around 270–300
mOsm/kg).
Hypotonic  fluids are more dilute than blood (lower concentration of solutes, < ~270 mOsm/kg).
Hypertonic  fluids are more concentrated than blood (higher solute concentration, > ~300
mOsm/kg).•

---PAGE---

These differences significantly affect gastric emptying  (how fast fluid leaves the stomach and enters
the intestine for absorption) and absorption :
Hypotonic Drinks:  Because they are more dilute than body fluids, hypotonic drinks tend to be
absorbed very quickly. They exert low osmotic pressure, so the stomach can empty them fast
and the intestine can absorb them readily without needing additional water to dilute them. A
classic example of a hypotonic solution is plain water (having no solute). However , water contains
no electrolytes or fuel. Other examples include very dilute sports drinks or electrolyte solutions
formulated  primarily  for  hydration  (with  minimal  sugar).  For  instance,  a  drink  with  a  2-4%
carbohydrate concentration plus electrolytes can be hypotonic. These fluids are ideal when the
priority is rapid hydration  without adding many calories — such as during shorter workouts in
high heat, or for an athlete with a high sweat rate who needs to get fluid in quickly. They are
gentle on the stomach and quench thirst effectively.
Isotonic Drinks:  These strike a balance, designed to match the body’s fluid composition for
efficient absorption while still delivering some energy. Most traditional sports drinks (like the
ones often provided at marathon aid stations or sold for exercise) are isotonic or close to it. They
typically contain about 6-8% carbohydrate  (6-8 grams of sugar per 100 ml of fluid) along with
electrolytes (sodium, potassium, etc.). At this concentration, the drink’s osmolality is similar to
that of blood, which means the stomach can empty it at a moderate pace and the intestine can
absorb both the water and the sugars effectively. Isotonic drinks provide a compromise between
hydration and fuel: they won’t hydrate quite as fast as pure water , but they give needed sugar for
energy. For many endurance events, especially those around 1-3 hours, isotonic drinks are a
staple because they help maintain blood glucose and delay fatigue while also keeping you
hydrated.
Hypertonic Drinks:  These contain a higher concentration of solutes than the bloodstream.
Examples  include  undiluted  fruit  juices,  regular  sodas,  syrupy  energy  drinks,  or  certain
specialized high-carb endurance fuels (some drink mixes or gels when mixed with minimal water
are hypertonic). Hypertonic fluids  empty from the stomach more slowly  because their high
solute load needs to be diluted in the gut for absorption to occur . In fact, a hypertonic solution
can draw water out of the bloodstream and surrounding tissues into the intestine (through
osmosis)  to  dilute  the  contents,  which  can  temporarily  dehydrate  the  body  or  cause
gastrointestinal distress (bloating, cramping). During exercise, this is usually not desirable, as it
can  lead  to  that  sloshing  feeling,  delayed  fluid  uptake,  and  sometimes  diarrhea.  However ,
hypertonic solutions deliver a lot of carbohydrate per volume, which is useful for meeting energy
needs  when  fluid  intake  is  limited  (e.g.,  some  ultra-distance  runners  might  sip  on  a  very
concentrated carb drink slowly, to get calories in without carrying a huge volume of fluid).
To visualize the difference: imagine three scenarios – drinking water vs. sports drink vs. a coke – during
a run. Water (hypotonic) will hydrate quickly, but provides no energy or electrolytes; a well-formulated
sports drink (isotonic) will hydrate fairly quickly and give some energy; cola (hypertonic due to high
sugar) might give a quick sugar hit in the mouth and early intestine, but overall it will sit longer in the
stomach and could cause issues if not diluted with some water .
Effect on performance and comfort:  - In most cases for endurance exercise,  isotonic or slightly
hypotonic fluids are preferred during activity , because they strike a good balance between hydration
and fueling. Many commercial sports drinks are engineered to be isotonic when used as directed (for
example,  mixing  a  powder  in  the  specified  amount  of  water  or  drinking  a  ready-to-use  bottle).  -
Hypotonic drinks or water  are great when carbohydrate intake is being met by other sources (like gels
or chews) or in shorter events where you don’t need extra carbs, and you primarily need fluid. They•

minimize any risk of GI upset because they empty so quickly. - Hypertonic sources  (like gels) are often
used in tandem with water . Athletes will take a gel (which is essentially a syrup of ~20-30 g of carbs in a
very small amount of water , making it hypertonic) and then chase it with a few gulps of water to help
dilute it. The combination in the stomach becomes closer to isotonic. Similarly, some runners might
drink a mouthful of a very concentrated energy drink but also regularly sip water from another bottle to
balance it out.
Gastric emptying speed:  Apart from tonicity, other factors affect how quickly your stomach empties: -
Exercise intensity: At very high intensities (above ~80% VO₂max), gastric emptying tends to slow down
because blood flow is diverted away from the gut to the muscles and the stress response can inhibit
digestion. That’s why it’s often easier to handle fluids and foods at moderate intensities than while
pushing near your max. - Volume: The stomach empties faster when it has a larger volume of fluid in it
(up to a point). So taking small but frequent sips can keep a steady flow, whereas chugging a huge
amount at once might cause a delay or overload. - Temperature: Cool fluids can sometimes absorb
faster and are more palatable in heat, whereas very cold or very hot fluids might cause the stomach to
react or slow a bit (extremes can shock the gut). - Individual conditioning: As noted before in gut
training,  some  athletes  have  trained  themselves  to  handle  more  and  have  faster  emptying  rates,
whereas others might naturally have more sensitive stomachs.
In sum, understanding tonicity helps in choosing the right fluids : - Use hypotonic  fluids (water , very
dilute electrolyte drinks) when you need rapid hydration above all, or if you are combining with other
calorie sources. - Use  isotonic  drinks when you want a one-stop solution for both hydration and a
moderate amount of carbs (typical marathon sports drink strategy). - Be cautious with hypertonic  fluids
during exercise; if you use them (like gels or concentrated mixes), always take some water alongside
and be mindful of stomach cues. Hypertonic drinks are more useful for post-exercise rehydration with
carbs, or during ultra events at aid stations (for example, sipping on some flat cola for a caffeine/sugar
boost but knowing you might need water soon after).
3.2 Calculating Sweat Rate and Sodium Loss to Prevent Hyponatremia
One of the best ways to personalize your hydration strategy is to determine your own sweat rate and
sweat composition (especially how much sodium you lose in your sweat). This allows you to plan how
much  to  drink  and  how  to  replace  electrolytes,  rather  than  relying  on  generic  advice.  It’s  a
straightforward process to estimate sweat rate:
Sweat Rate Calculation (Basic Sweat Test):
Weigh yourself before exercise:  Do this preferably nude or in minimal clothing (dry) to get an
accurate baseline. Use a reliable scale. For best results, do the weighing right before a planned
run of a known duration (say 1 hour). Also, note the conditions (temperature, humidity) and
intensity, because your sweat rate will be higher in hot/humid weather or at higher intensities.
Exercise for a set duration (e.g., 1 hour):  During this run, keep track of exactly how much
fluid you consume  (if any). For accuracy, it’s best if you do not urinate during the test run; if you
do, that urine loss should be factored out since it’s weight loss not from sweat.
Weigh yourself after exercise:  As soon as possible after finishing, towel off sweat from your
body and hair (sweat on your skin can add to weight). Weigh nude or in the same clothes (now
sweaty) that you weighed in before, keeping in mind if clothes are soaked they can hold some
sweat weight — weighing nude eliminates that variable.1.

Calculate weight change:  Subtract the post-exercise weight from the pre-exercise weight. For
example, if you were 70.0 kg before and 69.0 kg after , you lost 1.0 kg during exercise.
Account for fluid intake:  Convert your weight loss to milliliters of sweat lost. 1 kg of weight loss
is approximately equal to 1 liter (1000 ml) of water . In the example, 1.0 kg = 1000 ml sweat lost. If
you drank fluids during the run, add that volume to the total sweat loss , because that fluid
intake prevented additional weight loss but was still lost as sweat. For example, if you drank 500
ml of water during the run, and still lost 1.0 kg body weight, then your total sweat output was
1500 ml (you replaced 500 ml while running, but still came out 1000 ml down).
The basic formula is:
Total Sweat Loss (ml) = (Body weight pre - Body weight post) * 1000 + Fluid intake (ml) - Urine
output (ml) .
(Urine output is usually zero if you don’t pee during the run. If you did pee, you’d have to measure that
somehow or estimate, which is one reason the test is best done without bathroom breaks.)
Determine hourly sweat rate:  If your test run was exactly one hour , the total sweat loss in ml is
your sweat rate per hour (ml/hour). If the test was shorter or longer , extrapolate to an hourly
rate. For example, if the test was 30 minutes and you lost 0.5 kg with no fluid intake, that’s 500
ml in 0.5 hr , which doubles to ~1000 ml/hr sweat rate under those conditions.
Repeat for different conditions:  Sweat rate can vary a lot with weather and intensity. It can be
useful to do this test for a hard workout vs an easy one, or a hot day vs a cool day, to get a
range. You might find you only sweat 0.5 L/hr on a cool 50°F easy run, but 1.5 L/hr on a hard run
in  80°F  heat.  Armed  with  this,  you  can  adjust  your  race  hydration  plan  for  the  expected
conditions (and adjust on the fly if conditions change).
Now, replacing fluid losses : It’s generally not necessary (or sometimes not feasible) to drink enough to
replace 100% of sweat losses during exercise. A mild to moderate fluid deficit (like losing 1-2% of body
weight) is normal and usually does not hurt performance much. However , larger losses (3-4%+) can
impair performance (cardiac output is reduced, body temperature rises more, etc.). The goal in long
races  is  often  to  stay  under  ~2-3%  loss  if  possible  by  drinking  appropriately.  At  the  same  time,
overdrinking  (gaining  weight,  or  0%  loss)  can  be  risky  because  it  may  lead  to  hyponatremia  if
electrolytes aren’t replaced.
Sodium Loss and Replacement:
Sweat isn’t just water; it contains electrolytes, with sodium being the most significant. Sodium in sweat
is typically in the range of 400 to 1600 milligrams per liter (mg/L), with an average around 800-1000 mg/
L for many people. Some people are “salty sweaters” — you’ll notice white salt streaks on their skin or
clothes after a run, or the sweat tastes very salty — indicating they are at the higher end of sodium loss.
Others are more efficient with salt and lose less.
Knowing your sweat sodium concentration is ideal (there are sweat tests where a patch or pouch
collects sweat and is analyzed), but if you don’t have access to that, you can estimate: - If you often have
salt crystals on your skin or crave salty foods after workouts, you might be on the higher end (say 1000+
mg/L). - If your sweat stings your eyes a lot or tastes very salty, that’s another sign of high salt content. -
If you don’t notice much salt residue and your sweat tastes only mildly salty, you might be more
moderate (600-800 mg/L). - Keep in mind factors like acclimatization: as you get fitter or more heat-
acclimatized, your body can conserve sodium better (sweat becomes a bit less salty).4.

---PAGE---

To calculate sodium loss per hour: multiply your sweat rate (L/hr) by your sweat’s sodium concentration
(mg/L). For instance: - Say you lose 1.2 L/hour and your sweat has ~800 mg/L sodium. You’d be losing
about 1.2 * 800 = 960 mg of sodium per hour . - Or , if you’re a very salty sweater losing 1.5 L/hour at
1200 mg/L, that’s 1.5 * 1200 = 1800 mg sodium per hour  (!).
This  number  can  help  you  plan  electrolyte  intake:  -  In  the  first  example,  to  roughly  keep  sodium
balance,  you’d  want  close  to  900-1000  mg  of  sodium  intake  per  hour  in  your  fluids/foods  during
exercise. Many sports drinks provide something like 200-500 mg per liter , which might be insufficient if
you’re a heavy salty sweater , so you might need to choose a higher-sodium drink, add electrolyte tabs,
or take salt capsules. - In the second example (heavy loss), it would be hard to fully match 1800 mg/hr
intake (because that’s quite high and too much salt at once can also be bad), but you’d certainly aim to
get at least 500-1000+ mg/hr and accept finishing the event a bit sodium-depleted but within safe limits,
then rehydrate with salts after .
Preventing Hyponatremia:  Hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels) during or after an endurance
event is usually caused by a combination of excessive fluid intake and inadequate sodium. Essentially, if
you drink a lot of plain water (or any low-sodium fluid) and don’t replace the salt you’re sweating out,
your blood can become diluted. The symptoms range from mild (headache, nausea, bloating, puffiness,
maybe slight confusion) to severe (vomiting, severe confusion, seizures, even coma or death in worst
cases). It’s a serious condition often seen in slower marathon or ultra participants who overconsume
water due to overzealous hydration advice or fear of dehydration.
To avoid hyponatremia: - Don’t overdrink:  Use your thirst and your sweat rate as guides. If you know
you lose ~500 ml per hour , you generally don’t need to be drinking 1000 ml per hour “just to be safe” —
that could overshoot and dilute you. Conversely, if you’re sweating 1500 ml/hour , drinking only 200 ml
per hour could leave you severely dehydrated; so aim to get closer to what you lose, but not more than
you lose. Many sports medicine experts now advise to “drink to thirst” as a simple rule, which naturally
prevents excessive intake in most cases. Thirst is a decent indicator , though it lags slightly behind actual
needs, so in long races a combination of thirst and a plan (from your sweat test data) works well. -
Include  sodium  in  endurance  event  nutrition:  This  can  be  accomplished  through  sports  drinks
(choose ones with higher sodium content for longer events), electrolyte capsules, or salty foods (for
ultra runs, athletes sometimes eat pretzels, broth, pickles, etc.). As a ballpark, ingesting 300-800 mg of
sodium per hour  during long exercise is a common recommendation, adjusting up or down based on
individual losses. For very heavy salt sweaters, even more (1000+ mg/h) may be needed. Often, sports
drinks alone won’t supply that upper end, so supplements or salt tabs are used. - Monitor for signs:
Pay attention to any feelings of being overfull of water , nausea, or hands/feet swelling (a sign of water
retention/hyponatremia). If you’ve been drinking a lot and not taking salt, and you feel bloated and your
rings are tight on your fingers, ease off fluids and take a salt source if possible. Conversely, dark
concentrated urine, excessive thirst, and no need to urinate for many hours are signs of dehydration —
drink more in that case. -  Post-race rehydration:  Interestingly, a lot of hyponatremia cases actually
manifest after finishing (because people might chug a ton of water at the finish line on a sodium-
depleted body). To rehydrate safely post-exercise, include sodium (drink a sports drink or eat salty
snacks) and don’t force fluids beyond thirst. Your body will correct the balance over time if you give it
both water and salt.
By calculating your sweat rate and understanding your sodium needs, you can tailor a strategy that
keeps  you  in  the  Goldilocks  zone  of  hydration:  not  too  little,  not  too  much.  This  means  better
performance (since even 2% dehydration can hurt endurance, but 0% loss isn’t necessary) and safety
(avoiding the dangerous dilution of blood sodium). Remember that hydration and fueling plans often
need small tweaks as conditions change, so use your plan as a guide, but stay flexible and pay attention
to your body’s signals during the event.

4. Recovery Nutrition: The Window of Opportunity
After crossing the finish line of a hard run or completing an intense training session, the work isn’t over
— the focus shifts to recovery and rebuilding. Nutrition in the post-exercise period (especially the first
minutes and hours after stopping) can dramatically influence how quickly you bounce back, how well
your  muscles  adapt  and  strengthen,  and  how  prepared  you  are  for  the  next  session.  Two  major
components  of  recovery  nutrition  are  glycogen  replenishment  and  muscle  repair .  This  section
explores the biochemistry of glycogen resynthesis — including why the first 30 minutes after exercise
are often deemed the “critical window” for refueling — and discusses protein needs (particularly the role
of leucine in stimulating muscle protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway) after endurance vs. strength
workouts.
4.1 The Biochemistry of Glycogen Resynthesis (Why the First 30 Minutes Matters)
Glycogen  is the storage form of carbohydrate in our muscles (and liver). During endurance exercise,
especially  anything  longer  than  about  90  minutes  or  high-intensity  efforts,  significant  amounts  of
glycogen are used for energy. By the end of a long run or strenuous race, muscle glycogen stores can
be very low or even nearly depleted in the specific muscles used. Replenishing this glycogen is critical
for recovery, because it restores your muscles’ primary fuel supply for the next bout of exercise.
The  body  will  restore  glycogen  on  its  own  given  enough  time  and  carbohydrates,  but  there  is  a
biochemical advantage to refueling quickly :
Exercise increases glycogen synthase activity:  Glycogen synthase is the enzyme responsible
for  converting  glucose  to  glycogen.  During  exercise,  especially  as  glycogen  gets  depleted,
glycogen synthase is activated (through various cell signaling mechanisms). This heightened
activity  persists  for  a  short  period  after  exercise,  meaning  the  muscle  is  primed  to  make
glycogen rapidly  if glucose is available . Think of it like the muscle’s glycogen “tank” has been
drained and all the filling machinery is running on high speed, ready to store fuel.
Insulin sensitivity is elevated:  After exercise, muscle cells are more sensitive to insulin, the
hormone  that  facilitates  glucose  uptake  into  cells.  Moreover ,  exercise  itself  causes  GLUT4
transporters (the doors that let glucose into muscle cells) to move to the cell surface even
without insulin. In the immediate post-exercise window, your muscles can take up glucose at an
accelerated rate with less insulin needed. Consuming carbohydrates at this time leads to an
efficient uptake of glucose into muscle rather than being stored elsewhere.
Rapid  phase  of  glycogen  resynthesis:  Studies  have  identified  a  rapid  phase  of  glycogen
resynthesis in the first ~30–60 minutes post-exercise where glycogen is replenished at a much
faster rate than normal. If carbohydrates are provided during this phase, the rate of glycogen
storage can be twice as fast  as it would be if carb intake is delayed. After this initial window,
the rate of glycogen synthesis gradually slows down to more normal levels, even if you eat a lot
later .
To  capitalize  on  this,  nutritionists  often  recommend  a  strategy  sometimes  called  the  "glycogen
window"  or the "post-exercise window of opportunity." The practical guideline that emerged is to
consume carbohydrates as soon as feasible after a workout or race, ideally within the first 30 minutes. A
common recommendation is about 1.0 to 1.2 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight  in
the first hour post-exercise (with an emphasis on the earliest part of that hour). For a 70 kg athlete,
that’s about 70-84 grams of carbs.• 
• 
• 
13

---PAGE---

For example, 70-80 grams of carbs could be roughly: a large banana (~30g) + 500 ml of a sports drink
(~30g) + an energy bar (~20g). That would cover the immediate needs. This might sound like a lot right
after a hard effort, but liquids and easily digestible forms can go down more easily when you might not
feel like chewing much.
Real-world scenarios:  - If you’re an athlete who has another training session later in the day (say, a
morning workout and an afternoon workout), or in a multi-day competition, this immediate refueling
becomes even more crucial . The sooner you restock glycogen, the more recovered you’ll be for the
next bout. - If you won’t be exercising again until the next day or you have a light training load, the
urgency is less extreme, but it’s still beneficial to start recovery nutrition early. It might not make a huge
difference if you eat at 15 minutes vs 60 minutes after a short easy run, but after something like a 20-
mile training run, getting some carbs in quickly can help you feel better for the rest of the day and
reduce that “hangry” lag.
What about combining carbs with protein?  Carbs are the star for glycogen, but adding a little protein
can assist recovery in a couple of ways: - Protein supplies amino acids for muscle repair (see next
section on leucine and mTOR). - Protein and certain amino acids can stimulate a bit more insulin release
when taken with carbs, which can further promote glucose uptake. Some studies showed that when
carb intake is suboptimal, adding protein can boost glycogen storage (e.g., if you can’t tolerate enough
carbs, a bit of protein helps store what you did eat more efficiently). However , if you already consume a
high amount of carbs (>1 g/kg in that first hour), adding protein doesn’t significantly increase the rate of
glycogen storage beyond that — but it still helps with muscle repair , so it’s generally recommended to
include protein.
30 minutes vs a few hours:  It’s not like a magical door slams shut after 30 minutes, but the processes
do slow. If circumstances prevent you from eating right away, just eat as soon as you reasonably can.
The difference is more pronounced in scenarios of multiple daily workouts. If you have 24 hours until
next exercise, studies have found that total intake over the day matters more than precise timing.
However , practically speaking, most athletes feel better and recover better with an early snack rather
than waiting a long time, and it helps rehydrate and restock energy which can prevent excessive fatigue
later in the day.
In summary,  the first 30 minutes after exercise is a prime time to start refueling  because your
muscles  are  extremely  receptive  to  nutrients.  Taking  advantage  of  this  window  by  consuming
carbohydrate (and some protein) can accelerate glycogen replenishment, which in turn means better
recovery and preparedness for upcoming training sessions.
4.2 Protein for Recovery: The Leucine Threshold and mTOR Activation (Endurance vs
Strength)
While carbohydrates refuel energy stores, protein is the key nutrient for repairing and rebuilding
muscle tissues  after exercise. During exercise, especially high-intensity or prolonged activities, muscle
fibers suffer micro-damage and some protein is broken down. The body’s adaptive response is to repair
this damage and strengthen the fibers (in endurance training, this means making them more fatigue-
resistant  and  increasing  mitochondrial  proteins;  in  strength  training,  it  means  adding  contractile
proteins to grow the fiber). Providing protein after exercise gives the raw materials (amino acids) for this
repair and building process.
Leucine and mTOR:  Leucine is an essential amino acid, notable for its ability to trigger muscle protein
synthesis (MPS). It acts as a metabolic signal via the mTOR pathway — basically, when leucine levels in
14

---PAGE---

the muscle cell rise above a certain threshold, it tells the cell “nutrients are available, time to build new
proteins.” This threshold phenomenon is why sports nutritionists talk about the “leucine threshold” for
stimulating MPS.
The leucine threshold for a young adult is roughly 2-3 grams of leucine  in one meal or feeding.
For older adults (who have some anabolic resistance), the threshold is higher , around 3-4 grams.
Different protein sources have different leucine content. For instance, whey protein is about 11%
leucine by weight, one of the highest. So a 20 g serving of whey has ~2.2 g leucine, enough to hit
the threshold for many people. Soy protein is around 8% leucine (20 g soy ~1.6 g leucine), and
something like pea protein is lower still in leucine percentage, meaning you’d need a larger
serving to reach the same leucine intake.
It’s not necessary to over-think leucine if you are consuming ample high-quality protein, because
you will naturally get enough. But it’s a useful concept to ensure quality and quantity : about
20-25 g of a high-quality protein (like dairy, eggs, meat, or a balanced plant protein blend) will
usually provide the needed leucine.
Post-exercise protein needs for endurance vs strength:  - After  strength training  (weightlifting,
resistance workouts), the primary goal is to maximize muscle repair and growth. The muscle fibers have
been  heavily  loaded,  causing  microtears  and  stimulating  them  to  grow  stronger .  Research  has
consistently  shown  that  consuming  protein  soon  after  strength  exercise  (and  in  regular  intervals
throughout the day) enhances muscle protein synthesis and leads to greater gains in muscle size and
strength over time. A common recommendation is ~20-30 g of protein in the post-workout meal for a
strength athlete. This typically contains sufficient leucine (2-3 g) to fully stimulate mTOR and MPS. Some
bodybuilders or larger athletes may consume more (30-40 g) if they have a lot of muscle mass or if the
protein source is less optimal (to ensure enough EAA and leucine).
After  endurance  training ,  especially  if  it’s  a  long  run  or  intense  session,  muscle  protein
breakdown does occur and muscles still need repair (even though the focus of training was
endurance, not hypertrophy). Additionally, endurance training triggers production of many new
proteins  (like  enzymes  and  mitochondria,  as  mentioned).  Providing  protein  can  aid  these
processes. Endurance athletes might not aim to bulk up, but they do need to repair muscle
fibers  (to  prevent  excessive  breakdown  and  injury)  and  to  adapt  (increase  mitochondrial
proteins, capillary enzymes, etc.). The recommended protein intake after endurance exercise is in
a similar range: ~15-25 g of protein, ideally consumed within an hour or so after the session
(along with carbs as discussed). That amount also ensures about 2+ g leucine if it’s high-quality
protein.
One difference might be the carb-to-protein ratio  of the recovery intake:
For a pure strength session (where you didn’t burn a huge amount of glycogen, but you did
stress muscles), you might have a lower carb, higher protein recovery meal (e.g., 20 g protein
with maybe 20-40 g carbs, so a 1:1 or 2:1 carb:protein ratio). This is often sufficient because
muscle glycogen might not be heavily depleted from a weightlifting session, and the immediate
need is more about protein.
For a long endurance session, you likely need more carbs. So you might have 3:1 or 4:1 ratio of
carbs:protein. For example, a chocolate milk is roughly 4:1 (about 30 g carbs, 7-8 g protein per
cup), which is why it became a famous recovery drink for endurance athletes. If you have 2 cups,
that’s ~60 g carbs, 16 g protein — pretty close to the targets for a medium-sized athlete.
Many commercial recovery drinks for endurance are in the 3:1 range (like 60 g carbs, 20 g
protein per serving).•

Total daily protein  for endurance vs strength athletes: Interestingly, the recommended daily
protein intake for endurance athletes is not drastically lower than that for strength athletes,
because endurance training still has significant protein turnover . Endurance athletes are usually
advised to consume 1.2-1.6 g of protein per kg body weight per day , whereas strength/power
athletes might aim for 1.6-2.2 g/kg . The overlap is considerable. A marathon runner might be
fine on 1.4 g/kg, while a weightlifter might shoot for 2.0 g/kg. The difference is partly because
the strength athlete is actively trying to gain muscle mass, whereas the endurance athlete is
mainly  trying  to  repair  and  maintain  muscle  while  also  possibly  trying  to  stay  lighter  for
performance. Regardless, both benefit from spreading protein across meals (e.g., 20-30 g per
meal, 4-5 times per day, rather than all at once).
Timing and distribution:  For muscle protein synthesis, it’s not just the immediate post-workout
protein that matters, but the regular intake of protein throughout the day. After a hard session,
muscle  protein  synthesis  can  be  elevated  for  24  hours  or  more  (especially  after  resistance
training). This means you should  continue to get protein in your subsequent meals and
snacks . The concept of the leucine threshold applies at each feeding: you trigger MPS for a
couple of hours, then it tapers until the next protein feeding. So, for optimal recovery and
adaptation, having protein every ~3-4 hours while awake is often recommended for athletes in
heavy training.
Endurance and mTOR vs AMPK:  A quick note on molecular biology — endurance exercise
activates AMPK and other pathways that are somewhat contrary to mTOR (which is more about
building  up).  This  raised  a  question:  does  endurance  training  “blunt”  muscle  building?
Conversely, does eating protein and activating mTOR interfere with endurance adaptations? The
consensus is that these processes can coexist. After an endurance workout, taking protein will
activate mTOR for muscle repair , but it doesn’t stop the endurance adaptations from happening;
those are triggered by the exercise and will proceed as long as you’re not doing something
extreme like taking high-dose anti-inflammatory drugs or something that directly blocks those
signals.  So,  endurance  athletes  should  not  avoid  protein  for  fear  of  interfering  with  their
adaptation — quite the opposite, protein will help rebuild what needs to be rebuilt so you can
train again.
Practical protein choices:  - High-quality, quickly digested proteins like whey isolate or chocolate milk
are great immediately post-exercise because they digest fast and are rich in leucine. - If you prefer
whole foods: Greek yogurt, a tuna sandwich, eggs, or a smoothie with milk/yogurt and some protein
powder , are all good options. During a multi-hour ultra event, sometimes athletes even consume some
whole food protein (like bits of jerky or peanut butter) to stave off muscle breakdown, but that’s more
for ultras. - For plant-based athletes: combinations like pea and rice protein (to get a complete amino
profile), soy milk (soy is a decent source of leucine among plant proteins), or a meal like rice and beans
(though the latter is slower to digest) can work. It might just require a bit more quantity to hit the
leucine threshold.
In conclusion,  after any demanding exercise, both carbs and protein are your recovery friends .
Carbs refuel your tank; protein rebuilds the engine. By ensuring you get enough of each when it counts
(carbs immediately to restore glycogen, protein throughout the recovery period to repair muscle with a
leucine-rich source), you can significantly improve the effectiveness of your recovery. This means you’ll
come back stronger in the subsequent training sessions, and over time, those marginal gains add up to
better performance.•

5. Practical Coaching Guide and Key Takeaways
We’ve covered a lot of scientific detail — now let’s translate these insights into practical advice for
athletes and coaches. This section summarizes the key points from each topic above in a concise,
actionable  manner .  It's  aimed  at  both  amateur  and  semi-pro  endurance  runners,  emphasizing  a
balanced approach that leverages science without losing sight of individual needs and preferences. Use
these as guiding principles to optimize your nutrition around training and racing:
Intra-Race  Fueling  (Carbohydrates  During  Exercise):  -  Aim  for  30–90  g  of  Carbs  per  Hour,
Depending on Duration:  For exercise lasting more than ~60–90 minutes, consuming carbohydrates
can improve performance. Races or runs up to ~2 hours might require ~30-60 g/hour; longer events
(marathon, ultras) generally benefit from the higher end, ~60-90 g/hour . - Use Multiple Carb Sources
(Glucose + Fructose):  Choose sports drinks, gels, or foods that provide a mix of sugars (check labels for
glucose, maltodextrin, and fructose). The ideal mix is around a 2:1 ratio of glucose to fructose. This
ensures  you’re  using  both  SGLT1  and  GLUT5  transporters  and  getting  maximal  uptake.  Most
endurance-specific products are formulated this way. - Practice Your Fueling in Training: Gut training
is crucial.  During long training sessions, simulate race fueling. If your race plan is 60+ g/hour , don’t wait
until race day to try it. Introduce carbs gradually, and find the brands/flavors that sit well with you. Over
weeks, your gut will adapt to the volume and timing. - Distribute Intake (Don’t Gulp it All at Once):
Rather than a huge bolus once an hour , take smaller , more frequent doses (e.g., a couple of gulps of
sports  drink  every  10-15  minutes,  or  a  gel  every  30-40  minutes  with  water).  Steady  intake  helps
maintain blood sugar and minimizes GI overload. - Know Your Products:  Gels typically have ~20-25 g
carbs each; standard sports drink mix might have ~40-50 g per 500 ml (check brand). Plan accordingly
(e.g., 2-3 gels + 500 ml sports drink per hour could reach ~90 g, but that’s a lot—build up to it). - Adjust
for Intensity and Individuality:  In higher-intensity races (like a half marathon), some athletes might
find it hard to take in 60+ g/hour without issue, so they aim a bit lower . In ultras, where intensity is
lower , the gut may allow more solid food and variety (some ultrarunners even eat bananas, energy bars,
etc., for flavor/texture variety). Find what works for you.
“Train Low, Race High” (Carb Periodization):  - Use Low-Carb Training Strategically, Not Excessively:
Do  a  few  sessions  a  week  on  low  glycogen  (like  fasted  morning  runs  or  twice-a-day  sessions),  to
stimulate fat adaptation. But most of your key workouts should be well-fueled so you can perform
optimally and get quality training. - Never Compromise Recovery and Health:  After doing a “train low”
workout, make sure to eat a good meal with carbs and protein. Avoid stringing together multiple days
of  heavy  training  with  insufficient  carbs;  it’s  a  recipe  for  burnout  and  RED-S.  If  you  start  feeling
chronically tired or see warning signs (e.g., for women, menstrual changes; for all, persistent fatigue or
poor recovery), increase your energy intake and possibly reduce the frequency of low-fuel sessions. -
Carb-Loading for Races:  “Race high” means on race week you should not be skimping on carbs. In fact,
for long races (marathon, ultra) you’ll likely do a carb-load (increasing carb percentage in diet for 1-3
days prior) to top off glycogen stores. Your training low sessions from before will have helped your fat
burn, but on race day you want all fuel tanks full  and then keep refueling during the race. - Balance is
Key:  Think of carbohydrate availability as a dial you turn up or down depending on the day’s goal. Hard
interval workout at the track? Turn it up (eat carbs beforehand, maybe take a sports drink if needed).
Easy recovery run or long slow run? You can turn it down a bit (maybe go out before breakfast or don’t
take carbs during). But always turn it back up when it’s time to recover .
Hydration and Electrolytes:  -  Determine Your Sweat Rate:  At least once, do a sweat test (weigh
yourself pre- and post-run) so you have a rough idea of how much you sweat under certain conditions.
This will inform how much you should aim to drink. Example: if you lose ~1 kg (1 liter) per hour , you
know that drinking about 0.75 L/hour might keep you fairly well-balanced in a long race (you’ll finish a
little dehydrated, which is okay). If you only lose 0.3 L/hour , you definitely don’t need to drink a liter per
17

hour (that could cause bloating or hyponatremia). -  Hydrate According to Thirst (and Conditions):
During runs, especially those over an hour , drink when you’re thirsty and try to space it out. Don’t force
huge volumes if you’re not thirsty; conversely, if it’s very hot and you’re parched, don’t ignore that. Your
body is good at signaling thirst in most cases. In very long events, plan to take in fluids regularly, but
adjust if you feel waterlogged or too dry. - Include Sodium for Long Duration or Heavy Sweating:  For
efforts beyond ~1-2 hours, or any time you’ll be sweating a lot, ensure your fluids have electrolytes,
particularly sodium. Standard sports drinks usually suffice for moderate conditions (they often have
200-400 mg sodium per 500 ml). In very long events or for salty sweaters, consider higher sodium
options (some powders have 700+ mg per 500 ml) or supplement with salt tabs or salty foods (pretzels,
broth at aid stations, etc.). This helps maintain performance and reduces cramping or hyponatremia
risk. - Understand Hypotonic vs Isotonic for Your Needs:  If you’re mostly concerned with hydration
(e.g., short race in heat), a more dilute drink or water + electrolyte tablets (hypotonic) might be best. If
you also need energy, use an isotonic sports drink that provides carbs. Avoid chugging full-strength
fruit juices or sodas during runs; if you really crave them, dilute them with water . - Don’t Overdo Water:
Hyponatremia has killed marathon runners. It’s preventable by not drinking beyond your sweat loss and
by using electrolyte-containing fluids. Remember that losing some weight (1-4% of body weight) by the
end of a race is normal. You do not need to “stay exactly the same weight” — trying to overdrink to
prevent any weight loss can backfire. 
Recovery Nutrition:  - Carb Replenishment Post-Run:  After a long or hard workout, try to consume a
good  amount  of  carbs  fairly  soon  (within  30  minutes  if  possible).  Aim  for  roughly  0.5-1  g  of
carbohydrate per kg  in that window (so maybe 30-70 g for many people, depending on body size and
workout intensity). This could be a sports drink, fruit, bread, cereal, or any high-carb food you tolerate
well. - Protein for Muscle Repair:  Pair those carbs with protein (about 15-25 g) . This can come from a
convenient shake, a glass of chocolate milk, yogurt, a sandwich with some meat, a protein bar , etc. This
helps repair muscle fibers and stimulates adaptation. Hitting the leucine threshold (~2+ g leucine) is
easiest with animal proteins (whey, milk, eggs, chicken, etc.), but vegans can combine plant proteins or
use soy/wheat-based proteins to achieve the same effect. - Don’t Neglect Rehydration:  Recovery isn’t
just about carbs and protein. You also need to rehydrate  and re-salt if you lost a lot in sweat. Continue
sipping fluids after exercise and include some salty foods or an electrolyte drink if you were depleted.
As a guideline, drink about 1.25–1.5 times the fluid you lost (so if down 1 kg, drink ~1.25-1.5 L over the
next few hours) to fully rehydrate. - The Next Meals:  Keep the recovery going with balanced meals. If
you had your post-run snack at the track or car , follow it up with a proper meal within a couple of hours.
Make sure that meal has a good source of carbs (to further replenish glycogen), protein (to keep
building  muscle),  and  plenty  of  colorful  veggies  or  fruits  (for  vitamins,  minerals,  antioxidants).  -
Consistency Over Perfection:  Hitting the 30-minute window is great, but what’s more important is the
overall pattern. Athletes who consistently fuel their bodies well day in and day out recover better than
those who do it spottily. So, develop a routine: for example, long run day might always end with a fruit
smoothie with protein powder as soon as you get home, then a big pasta or rice-based lunch a bit later .
Micronutrients  and  Supplements:  -  Micronutrient-Rich  Diet:  Endurance  runners  have  increased
needs for certain micronutrients. Focus on a diet rich in whole foods: - Iron:  Critical for red blood cells
and oxygen transport. Runners (especially women) are prone to iron deficiency. Include iron-rich foods
(red meat, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals) and pair plant sources with vitamin C
(for better absorption). If blood tests show low iron, an iron supplement might be needed under a
doctor’s guidance. -  Calcium and Vitamin D:  Important for bone health, muscle function, and nerve
signaling. Weight-bearing exercise helps bone density, but only if you have the nutrients to support it.
Dairy products, fortified plant milks, leafy greens (for calcium) and sunlight or supplements (for vitamin
D) are key. Many athletes take a D supplement, especially if training indoors or in winter . - Antioxidants
(Vitamin C, E, etc.):  These help repair the oxidative damage from hard training. Get them from fruits
and vegetables (berries, citrus, tomatoes, leafy greens, bell peppers, nuts). Be cautious with high-dose
18

---PAGE---

antioxidant supplements (like megadoses of C or E) around training; some research suggests they might
blunt some training adaptations by reducing the body’s natural signaling. Normal food amounts are
fine and beneficial. - B Vitamins:  Thiamin, riboflavin, B6, B12, etc., are involved in energy metabolism.
Endurance athletes need slightly more. Eating a variety of foods, including whole grains and lean
proteins,  usually  covers  this.  Vegans  should  supplement  B12,  since  it’s  mainly  in  animal  foods.  -
Magnesium, Zinc:  Often lost in sweat and important for muscle function and immune health. Nuts,
seeds, whole grains (for magnesium) and meat, seafood, seeds (for zinc) are good sources. A mild
deficiency can contribute to muscle cramps or poor recovery, so ensure your diet has these bases
covered.
Ergogenic Supplements (Use with Purpose):
Caffeine:  One of the most proven performance boosters. It can improve endurance by making
effort feel easier and increasing alertness. Typical usage: 3-6 mg/kg about 30-60 min before
exercise (for a 70 kg person, ~200-400 mg, i.e., 1-2 strong cups of coffee). Lower doses (like 100
mg, or even 50 mg “microdoses” during an ultra) can still help. Practice in training to gauge
tolerance (too much can cause jitters or GI upset).
Nitrate (Beetroot juice):  Can slightly improve exercise efficiency by dilating blood vessels and
reducing oxygen cost of exercise. Benefit is more noted in events lasting 5-30 minutes, but some
marathoners use it too for potential small gains. Typically, 500 ml of beet juice or a concentrated
shot provides the needed nitrate, taken ~2-3 hours pre-event. It can also be loaded for a few
days prior . Harmless to try (just expect pink-colored urine/stools!).
Beta-Alanine:  Helps buffer acid in muscles (so theoretically aids high-intensity sprinting at the
end of a race or hill surges). More relevant for middle-distance track athletes or CrossFit types
than pure endurance runners, but if you do a lot of intense interval training, it could reduce
fatigue. It requires daily dosing (e.g., 4-6 g per day split into smaller doses) for several weeks to
build up carnosine in muscles. Some runners take it; others skip it as the benefits for long races
are minimal.
Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) or Essential Amino Acids (EAAs):  Most endurance
athletes who eat sufficient protein won’t need extra BCAAs. However , in ultra events, BCAAs
during the race might help prevent mental fatigue (by competing with tryptophan uptake in the
brain) and provide a bit of fuel. Some ultra runners sip on BCAA supplements or have protein
(like slow-burning soy protein drink) during long races to minimize muscle catabolism. It’s an
advanced strategy and not necessary for marathons or shorter .
Recovery  supplements:  Things  like  tart  cherry  juice,  curcumin,  or  collagen  have  gained
popularity:
Tart cherry juice  is rich in anthocyanins and has been shown in some studies to reduce
muscle soreness and improve recovery from hard effort (like back-to-back marathon
days). Drinking ~8-12 oz of tart cherry juice for a few days around a race might help with
inflammation.
Collagen or gelatin with vitamin C  (taken ~30-60 min before a rehab or strength session)
has some evidence to aid tendon/joint recovery by providing specific amino acids (glycine,
proline) for collagen synthesis. Runners with tendon issues sometimes use this protocol.
Glutamine , Vitamin C , Echinacea , etc., for immune support – heavy training can suppress
immunity, so some use these. There’s mixed evidence; a well-balanced diet and adequate
rest are the strongest immune boosters, but some athletes swear by a glutamine
supplement or extra vitamin C during heavy training.
Psychological fuel:  Don’t underestimate the power of  enjoyment  in your nutrition. If having a
certain snack as recovery makes you happy and you look forward to it, that’s a positive for
consistency. Likewise, having a favorite flavor of sports drink or gel can be a little morale boost•

during a long, hard race. These things are individual — some love the taste of gel, others gag;
find what works for you.
Final Thoughts:  Every runner is unique, and the “best” nutrition plan is one that aligns with general
scientific  principles  and is  personalized  through  trial  and  error .  Amateurs  should  start  with  broad
guidelines (like those above) and gradually fine-tune based on experience and perhaps occasional
consultation with a nutrition expert. Semi-pro or elite runners might need to be even more precise —
often working with sports dietitians, getting sweat composition tests, blood work for micronutrients,
etc., to dial in the details — but they too must listen to their bodies and preferences (even pros have
foods they just won’t eat or strategies that don’t suit them).
Remember that nutrition is often called the “fourth discipline” of endurance sports (after training,
recovery,  and  mental  preparation).  Paying  attention  to  fueling,  hydration,  and  recovery  can  yield
significant  improvements  in  performance  and  how  you  feel.  The  strategies  outlined  here  —  from
optimizing intra-race fueling with multiple transportable carbs and a trained gut, to intelligently using
low-carb sessions for adaptation without falling into energy deficiency, to matching your hydration to
your sweat losses and environmental conditions, and capitalizing on the post-exercise recovery window
— are all tools you can use. But like any training tool, they should be applied thoughtfully, monitored,
and adjusted as needed.
In essence: Fuel smart, hydrate wisely, recover fully, and you’ll run at your peak.  Happy running and bon
appétit!
