Understanding the Central Governor Theory:
Pushing the Limits of Endurance
Introduction
Every endurance athlete, from marathon runners to cyclists, has felt that wall of fatigue – the burning
legs, ragged breath, and that nagging voice in your head urging you to slow down or stop. But have you
ever noticed that, despite feeling  utterly  spent, you can still sprint the last stretch of a race or find a
burst of energy when a finish line is in sight? This puzzling observation lies at the heart of an intriguing
idea in exercise science known as  Tim Noakes’ Central Governor Theory (CGT) . According to this
theory,  fatigue  isn’t  just  about  faltering  muscles  or  empty  fuel  tanks  –  it’s  also  a  protective
mechanism orchestrated by your brain . In this coaching-style guide, we will explore what the
Central Governor Theory is and its implications for your endurance limits. We’ll break down how the
brain regulates muscle power to prevent dangerous “catastrophic” failures of your body’s homeostasis,
clarify  the  difference  between  peripheral  fatigue  (in  your  muscles)  and  central  fatigue  (in  your
nervous system), and examine why a stressful day at work can leave you  feeling  weaker during your
evening run. Most importantly, we will discuss practical, science-backed strategies to “hack” or train this
central governor – helping you unlock that  reserve capacity  we all suspect is hidden just beyond the
point of exhaustion. 
Whether you’re a competitive runner , a coach, or a recreational athlete, understanding how your mind
and body interact during exercise can be a game-changer . Let’s dive into the science of fatigue and learn
how to push those limits safely and intelligently, turning that mysterious extra gear at the end of a race
into a reliable part of your endurance toolkit.
The Central Governor Theory: Your Brain as a Safety Regulator
In the traditional view of exercise fatigue, your  muscles  and cardiovascular system dictate when you
have  to  stop.  Run  hard  enough  and  eventually  lactic  acid  build-up,  depleted  energy  stores,  or
overheating muscles will force you to slow down – this is often called the “catastrophic failure” model
of fatigue . The assumption was that exercise continues to maximal effort until some part of the
body  physically  fails (for example, muscles literally can’t contract any more or the heart can’t pump
enough oxygenated blood). However , Dr . Tim Noakes , a South African exercise physiologist, challenged
this idea in the late 1990s by proposing the Central Governor Theory . This theory suggests that your
brain behaves like a “central governor” – a smart regulator that  anticipates  limits and imposes
fatigue before  your body is in genuine peril .
In  simpler  terms:  the  brain  continuously  monitors  your  body’s  internal  state  (heart  rate,
temperature, fuel levels, etc.) and the expected demands of your effort, and it calculates a safe
intensity level . If you approach levels of exertion that might threaten your body’s equilibrium
(homeostasis ), the brain proactively steps in to dial down your power output. It does this by reducing
the neural recruitment of muscle fibers , effectively limiting  how many of your muscle’s motor units
are activated, which in turn makes you feel fatigue and slow down . Fatigue, in this view, isn’t just
a physical event happening in the muscles , but a brain-induced sensation or emotion, meant to
protect you . 12

Implications for Endurance Performance Limits
The  Central  Governor  Theory  fundamentally  reframes  what  limits  our  endurance  performance.  If
fatigue is partially “all in the head” (as the saying goes), then  the true physiological limits – like
complete muscle failure or organ damage – are rarely reached during normal exercise . Instead, we
typically quit or slow down before  we hit those absolute limits, because the brain has a built-in safety
margin. Research supporting this comes from observations in real races: For example, marathoners
commonly manage a finishing sprint after 26 miles of hard running. Under the old catastrophic model,
this shouldn’t be possible – if you were truly at the limit, there would be no energy or muscle fibers left
to summon for a sprint. But the fact that a reserve exists indicates the body was holding something
back  under brain’s directives . In Tim Noakes’ words, athletes seem to  pace themselves “in
anticipation” , adjusting their effort based on duration and conditions, so that they  finish a race
without actually hitting complete physiological failure . Your brain essentially budgets your
energy and effort across the whole event.
This  has  huge  implications  for  endurance  performance:  it  means  that  your  mental  state,
expectations,  and  previous  experience  can  shape  how  your  central  governor  sets  the  ‘safety
limits’ . Noakes and colleagues noted that the brain’s calculation of safe exertion includes factors
like: 
Prior experience  with similar efforts (your brain remembers how bad things got last time),
The planned duration  or distance of the exercise (your brain paces effort if it “knows” you have
a long way to go),
Current physiological signals  (body temperature, level of muscle fuel, oxygen status, etc.), and 
Motivation or emotional state .
All  these  inputs  help  the  brain  decide  when  to  produce  that  fatigue  signal.  Essentially,  the  brain
intentionally leaves a reserve  to make sure you don’t run yourself to death . This is why you
rarely see healthy athletes literally dropping dead from exertion in a well-paced event – the body usually
slows down first. (Of course, in extreme environments or with certain stimulants that override signals,
people can push to dangerous collapse, but those are outliers.) As a coach or athlete, recognizing this
brain-governed limit means there may be  untapped potential  if you can safely nudge the governor’s
setting a bit higher . In practical terms: learning to manage your perception of effort and psychological
responses  during  exercise  could  let  you  access  more  of  the  performance  that  your  muscles  are
physically capable of. 
To be clear , the Central Governor Theory doesn’t mean your endurance is unlimited  or that training the
body is unimportant. Rather , it suggests a  dual ceiling : one set by the body’s mechanical/metabolic
limits, and a usually lower  one set by the brain to protect the body. The goal of training  is not only to
raise the physical limits (stronger heart, fitter muscles) but also to  teach the brain that it’s safe to
push closer to those limits . As we’ll explore, techniques from pacing strategy to mental skills can help
recalibrate  that  central  governor  so  you  can  sustainably  reach  a  higher  percentage  of  your  true
capacity.
Preventing “Catastrophic Failure”: How the Brain Safely Dials
Back Effort
One of the central questions we need to address is how the brain actually keeps you from pushing too
far . What does it mean to “prevent catastrophic homeostatic failure”? Homeostasis is the balance of
internal conditions (like maintaining a safe core temperature, blood pH, stable blood pressure, etc.).74

Catastrophic failure  would be something like your core temperature soaring to heatstroke levels, your
heart going into arrhythmia from overexertion, or your muscles completely seizing up and breaking
down from depletion or lack of oxygen. Obviously, those scenarios are life-threatening – and the central
governor’s job is to make sure normal exercise never quite gets that far .
Here’s how the brain (the central nervous system) is thought to regulate motor unit recruitment to
guard against those dangers :
Continuous Monitoring:  Your brain receives a constant stream of feedback from your body
during exercise. Sensors throughout your body report on things like blood oxygen level, carbon
dioxide, muscle temperature, blood glucose, electrolyte levels, and even the strain in your heart
and muscles. For example, rising muscle temperature or dropping blood glucose will be noted
by the brain. The brain essentially acts as a command center integrating these signals.
Integrated “Safe Effort” Calculation:  Using both the feedback signals and feed-forward info
(like knowing you plan to run 10 miles, not 1), your brain computes whether the current intensity
is sustainable without crossing a red line. If conditions are worsening (e.g. your muscles are
starting to get acidic or your heart is near max output), the brain will adjust by creating
the sensation of fatigue  – a warning symptom – to encourage you to slow down . Think
of fatigue as the body’s equivalent of the warning light on a car’s dashboard, coming on before
the engine blows up.
Selective Muscle Activation:  The brain can directly alter how many muscle fibers it’s asking to
work. Muscles are made of many motor units (a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it controls).
You never actually use 100% of your muscle fibers at once during voluntary exercise – there’s
always some fraction “off-line.” Under extreme effort you recruit more units, but  the central
governor will hold back a portion  in reserve . As a protective measure, the brain might
start  derecruiting  some  motor  units  or  reduce  the  firing  rate  of  neurons  as  you  approach
dangerous intensity. This reduction in motor unit recruitment leads to a drop in force output, i.e.
you feel weaker and slow down . Subjectively, it feels like heavy legs or inability to make your
muscles  go,  and  we  interpret  that  as  “muscle  fatigue.”  But  in  CGT,  the  brain  is  actively
throttling the muscle . One description put it this way: when your quadriceps are “burning” near
the end of a long run, it may not just be lactic acid –  it could be your brain deliberately
limiting the drive to those muscles, causing that burning sensation to force you to ease up
.
Avoiding  True  Crisis:  By  forcing  a  slow-down  or  an  end  to  exercise  at,  say,  95%  of  your
theoretical maximum capacity (just as an example), the central governor ensures that you don’t
hit 100% and have something catastrophic occur . For instance, most marathon runners finish
tired but physiologically stable – body temperature might be high but not always in heatstroke
range, the heart is beating fast but not failing. If someone  does  collapse or require medical
intervention at a finish line, it’s often because conditions (heat, dehydration, etc.) pushed them
close  to those catastrophic limits, or they overrode signals (sometimes seen in athletes who
refuse to stop despite dizziness or in those who used stimulants). Those are relatively rare
compared to the vast number who slow down appropriately.  The fact that most of us  slow
down  well before we drop dead is thanks to the brain’s preventive regulation .
A classic piece of evidence for this protective cutoff comes from laboratory tests: when an exhausted
athlete  says  “I  can’t  do  any  more”  during  a  max  effort  test,  they  often  still  have  some  untapped
muscular capability. If the experimenter electrically stimulates the athlete’s muscle at that point of
voluntary exhaustion, the muscle can still produce additional force. In other words, the person quit with•

some motor units not firing at full capacity – exactly what we’d expect if the brain had proactively
limited output. Under a purely peripheral fatigue model, by the time you stopped, all fibers would be
failing and an external stimulus couldn’t squeeze extra force out. But typically, that’s not what happens.
There’s a ‘safety reserve’ that the brain never let you use, which can be demonstrated by such
techniques . 
From a coaching perspective, understanding this mechanism highlights why pacing and self-regulation
are so important . Your brain is extraordinarily adept at figuring out how fast to let you go at the start of
a race so that you don’t burn out. If you fool it (or ignore it) by starting too fast , you will likely trigger
that shutdown mechanism earlier than desired. We’ve all experienced going out too hard and then
“hitting the wall” – that’s the central governor slamming the brakes because it perceives a potential
catastrophe  if  you  continued  at  that  reckless  pace .  Athletes  and  coaches  often  talk  about
“listening to your body,” and in a way, that means listening to the signals your brain is giving you about
pacing. However , as we will discuss, these signals can sometimes be too conservative , especially in
well-trained individuals. With training and mental techniques, you can push the point at which the brain
starts cutting power a little closer to your true physical limit – effectively raising  the threshold where the
warning light comes on.
Peripheral vs Central Fatigue: Two Sides of the Exhaustion Coin
So far , we’ve focused a lot on the brain’s role. But it’s important to understand that fatigue in endurance
exercise has  both peripheral and central components . These terms help us differentiate  where  the
limiting factors are occurring:
Peripheral Fatigue:  This refers to fatigue originating in the  muscles or peripheral nerves
themselves (essentially, outside the brain/spinal cord). If you imagine your muscles as an engine,
peripheral fatigue is anything that interferes with the engine’s ability to produce force. Classic
causes  include  metabolic  changes  in  muscle  fibers:  accumulation  of  lactic  acid  (and  the
associated  drop  in  pH),  depletion  of  glycogen  (muscle  energy  stores),  build-up  of  inorganic
phosphate, imbalances in calcium handling needed for muscle contraction, or simply damage to
muscle fibers. In a long run, peripheral fatigue is what makes your legs feel like lead – it’s a local
phenomenon. For example, when your quadriceps burn and refuse to lift your knees high at mile
20, peripheral mechanisms like metabolite buildup and microtrauma in muscle fibers are heavily
involved . Peripheral fatigue can be seen as the muscles “themselves” getting tired
or inefficient . If we measured your muscle fibers directly, we’d see a decline in their force output
capacity due to these biochemical changes.
Central  Fatigue:  This  refers  to  fatigue  that  originates  in  the  central  nervous  system  –
essentially, your brain and the pathway of nerve signals down to the muscles. Central fatigue
manifests as a reduced ability of the nervous system to voluntarily activate muscles . In
other words, even if the muscles are capable of more work, the brain isn’t delivering strong
enough signals to recruit those fibers or fire them rapidly. Central fatigue can be influenced by a
host of factors like neurotransmitter levels in the brain, the firing patterns of motor neurons, and
psychological state (motivation, pain tolerance). For instance, central fatigue might present as
that mental fog or lack of “drive” where you just  can’t  make yourself push harder, even
though your muscles aren’t yet at absolute failure . Physiologically, scientists define central
fatigue as a  decrease in voluntary muscle activation  – often measurable as a drop in the
frequency or synchronization of motor unit firing, or an observed gap between what force you
could  produce versus what you are producing .89

To  put  it  succinctly:  peripheral  fatigue  is  like  your  muscles  being  low  on  gas  or  overheating,
whereas central fatigue is like your brain easing off the gas pedal . Both result in you slowing down,
but for different reasons (and often both occur together). In any hard endurance effort,  fatigue is
usually a combination of both central and peripheral factors , intertwined in complex ways. 
Modern research talks about an “integrative” view of fatigue , meaning our performance limit is not
solely one or the other , but an interplay. Tim Noakes’ Central Governor Model leans heavily into central
regulation, but it doesn’t completely ignore peripheral fatigue – rather , it suggests that peripheral
signals  are  inputs  to  the  brain’s  decision-making  process.  The  Integrative  Governor  theory  (an
evolution of CGT used by some scientists) holds that central and peripheral fatigue are part of one
system working to maintain homeostasis . For example, if your muscles start burning (peripheral
signal), your brain senses that and might increase the fatigue sensation (central response) to make you
slow down, which in turn helps prevent further peripheral deterioration. 
Let’s differentiate clearly with an example scenario:
Peripheral  Fatigue  Example:  You’re  doing  squats  in  the  gym  (a  strength  exercise,  more
localized). After many reps, your quadriceps and glutes physically cannot contract with the same
force – even if you  try to push as hard as possible, the output drops. This is largely due to
peripheral fatigue – the local muscle fibers are depleted of ATP, pH is low from metabolite
buildup, etc. If someone electrically stimulated your quads at that moment, the force might still
be low because the muscle fibers themselves are exhausted. In endurance running, peripheral
fatigue builds up over time (e.g., muscle glycogen gets used up after 90+ minutes, contributing
to the infamous marathon “wall”).
Central Fatigue Example:  Now imagine a different scenario: you didn’t sleep well last night, you
had a stressful day at work, and now you’re trying to do a hard training run in the evening. You
might notice your mind  gives up early – you just feel like you can’t push, even though your legs
physically might have some energy. Or consider an ultra-runner late in a 100-mile race: they
might have plenty of fat fuel left and muscles still capable of moving, but their  central drive
diminishes – they become drowsy, less motivated, mentally drained. If we electrically stimulated
their muscles, we might get a surprising amount of force (meaning the muscles themselves
weren’t completely shot), indicating central fatigue was a big factor . In lab tests, central fatigue is
often measured by that technique: at exhaustion, give a muscle a jolt. If extra force is produced,
it  means  the  muscle  had  something  left  (so  the  limitation  was  central  –  the  brain  wasn’t
activating those fibers fully).
To further illustrate: Researchers define CNS fatigue as a decline in the ability to activate muscles
voluntarily , linked to reduced motor cortex drive and motor neuron firing . Peripheral fatigue  is
defined as reduction in muscle fiber contractile force due to changes at or beyond the neuromuscular
junction (the point where nerve meets muscle) . This could be due to depleted fuel or accumulation
of metabolites interfering with the muscle contraction process.
Why does this matter for you as an athlete? Because the strategies to combat fatigue depend on its
source . If you’re dealing with peripheral fatigue (say, muscle glycogen depletion), the fix might be
nutritional (e.g., take in carbohydrates to refuel) or pacing (slow down to use more fat, less glycogen). If
it’s central fatigue (say, you’re just mentally exhausted), the fix could be psychological (motivational self-
talk, music, etc.), neurological (caffeine to stimulate the CNS), or rest for your brain. In many cases,
especially in endurance sports, both types occur together , so you need a combination approach.1312

Consider a marathon: in the later miles, your muscles are low on glycogen (peripheral), and your brain is
sensing the prolonged stress and perhaps a drop in blood glucose (central). Peripheral fatigue makes
each  stride  less  powerful,  and  central  fatigue  might  manifest  as  the  desire  to  quit  or  difficulty  in
maintaining focus. The central governor model posits that the brain will interpret all these signals and
decide if you can keep pressing on or not. If you “hit the wall”, some of that is your muscles truly being
low on fuel, but some might be your brain essentially putting on the brakes because it perceives that
continuing at that intensity is too risky given the fuel status (to prevent, say, dangerously low blood
sugar or extreme muscle damage).
In summary, peripheral fatigue is about muscle capability, central fatigue is about neural drive .
Effective endurance training and performance optimization must address both: you train the body
(raise  the  peripheral  limits)  and train  the  brain  (raise  or  circumvent  the  central  limits).  Next,  we’ll
specifically examine how your mental state – such as being fresh versus mentally tired – can tilt this
balance by primarily affecting the central side of fatigue.
The Impact of Mental Fatigue: Why a Stressful Day Can Weaken
Your Run
Imagine you plan an evening workout. One day, you approach it feeling alert, positive, and mentally
fresh – the run feels smooth and you hit your splits. Another day, you come into it after hours of intense
mental work (maybe back-to-back meetings, or studying for exams, or a draining day dealing with life’s
stresses) and suddenly the same pace feels like a grind. You’re not significantly more physically tired
(perhaps you sat at a desk all day), yet your performance is worse. What’s going on? This is the effect
of mental fatigue on physical endurance performance , a real phenomenon that science has begun
to elucidate in the past decade or two.
Mental fatigue  is essentially a state of  cognitive tiredness  – your brain’s resources are depleted,
leading  to  feelings  of  low  energy,  reduced  motivation,  and  impaired  concentration.  It’s  what  you
experience after concentrating hard for a long time. From a biological standpoint, prolonged mental
effort changes levels of certain neurotransmitters and metabolites in the brain (for instance, it can
increase adenosine , a chemical that accumulates with wakefulness and causes sleepiness, which we’ll
detail shortly) . It also can involve stress hormones if the mental work was stressful (e.g., cortisol
might be elevated from a tough workday) . The upshot is  your brain in a mentally fatigued
state is less willing or able to drive your muscles hard .
A  landmark  study  in  2009  by  Samuele  Marcora  and  colleagues  demonstrated  this  clearly.  In  that
experiment, a group of people were given a mentally fatiguing task (90 minutes of a demanding
cognitive computer test) and then asked to cycle to exhaustion at a fixed effort level. The control group
just watched neutral documentaries (so their brains were relatively fresh) before the same cycling test.
The results:  the mentally fatigued folks gave up  significantly sooner  – about 15% less time to
exhaustion on average – despite their muscles and heart showing the same  physiological state as
the control group . In other words, their endurance was worse purely because their minds  were
tired, not because their bodies couldn’t do it. Heart rate, lactate, oxygen uptake – all the usual physical
fatigue markers – were similar between conditions . What differed was perception : those in a state of
mental fatigue reported a higher Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)  during the exercise for the same
physical work . They  felt like the effort was harder , so they reached their maximal tolerable effort
sooner and stopped earlier . The conclusion of the study was clear: “mental fatigue limits exercise
tolerance  in  humans  through  higher  perception  of  effort  rather  than  cardiorespiratory  or
musculoenergetic mechanisms” .14

Let’s unpack the biology of this a bit more. When you engage in demanding cognitive tasks or even
prolonged emotional stress, several things happen that can impact your physical performance:
Neurotransmitter  Changes:  One  hypothesis  is  that  sustained  mental  effort  alters  brain
neurochemistry in a way that induces fatigue. For instance,  adenosine  (a neurochemical that
builds up in the brain during wakefulness and mental activity) accumulates. There’s speculation
and some evidence that mental exertion raises adenosine levels particularly in the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC)  – a region of the brain heavily involved in perceiving effort and pain .
Adenosine, in turn, is known to inhibit neural activity (it’s what caffeine blocks to keep you alert).
So high adenosine could make your brain feel “tired” and less capable of driving muscles –
basically increasing the  sense of effort . Indeed, it’s noted that  increased brain adenosine is
associated  with  reduced  exercise  performance  (since  it  promotes  fatigue/sleepiness) .
Additionally, mental fatigue may also deplete or reduce the effectiveness of neurotransmitters
like dopamine or noradrenaline that are linked to motivation and alertness, although the exact
mechanisms are complex and still being studied.
Brain Energy and Metabolite Depletion:  Your brain consumes a lot of energy (glucose) when
you’re doing hard cognitive work. Some studies have shown that intense mental effort can
actually use up some of the brain’s own energy stores (like a form of brain glycogen, and high-
energy phosphates) . When the brain’s energy status is low, it could trigger fatigue signals
just as exercising muscle does when it’s low on fuel. Think of it as your mental muscle getting
tired , which then drags down the physical performance through central fatigue pathways.
Shared Neural Circuits for Effort:  The act of pushing yourself in exercise and the act of intense
concentration share some neural circuitry – particularly the ACC and prefrontal cortex, which are
involved in decision-making, attention, and effort allocation. If those circuits are already worn
out from a day of cognitive strain, they may register physical effort as more taxing than usual.
Essentially, your “effort meter” is already partly in the red before you even start your run .
Functional brain imaging has shown that mental fatigue is accompanied by increased activation
of regions like the ACC during subsequent physical tasks – suggesting the brain is having to work
harder to keep you going, and you feel that as increased effort for the same output .
Psychological Factors:  Mental fatigue often comes with mood changes – you might feel more
irritable or demotivated. A stressed brain can reduce your motivation  to endure discomfort. Even
if  physiologically  you  could  push,  you  might  not  care  enough  at  that  moment  due  to  the
depleted  willpower .  There’s  a  psychological  theory  of  fatigue  by  Marcora  called  the
“psychobiological  model”  which  posits  that  continuing  exercise  is  a  decision  weighed  by
perceived effort versus motivation. After mental fatigue, your perceived effort is higher and
sometimes your motivation is lower , tipping the scales towards quitting sooner . Interestingly
though, in the 2009 study, they measured motivation and found it wasn’t significantly lower in
the mental-fatigue condition , so the effect was really on the perception of effort primarily.
So, how much can a stressful day impact your run? Empirically, quite a bit. The cited study saw ~15%
drop in endurance performance after heavy mental work . Other studies have confirmed that mental
fatigue can slow your running pace, lower power output, and generally make exercise feel harder than
usual. If you’re preparing for a key training session or race, it’s worth considering your mental freshness
as part of your readiness. This is why coaches will sometimes advise athletes to minimize stressful
mental activities or get good rest before competitions  – it’s not just about resting muscles, but also
resting the mind.•

Biologically, we can say:  mental fatigue increases  central fatigue , not by damaging your muscles,
but by altering brain function . It raises the central governor’s sensitivity – the brain becomes more
protective and screams “stop” sooner than it would if fresh. It’s akin to running with your brain’s “safety
thermostat” set a bit lower; the alarm goes off at a lower body temperature or lesser degree of strain
than normal.
To put a real-world coaching spin on this: if you had a long, cognitively exhausting workday and you
plan a high-intensity run in the evening, be aware that it might feel tougher than it normally would. You
might not hit your desired splits,  not because you’re suddenly less fit, but because your central
governor is hitting the brakes earlier . Strategies like using some caffeine (if appropriate for you) or
doing  an  engaging  warm-up  to  “wake  up”  the  mind  can  mitigate  this  (more  on  caffeine  soon).
Alternatively, schedule intense workouts for times when you’re mentally fresh (morning or after a
relaxing day off, for example). On days where mental fatigue is unavoidable, don’t beat yourself up if
the workout is a struggle – recognize what’s happening and consider it a form of brain endurance
training in itself.
Interestingly, mental fatigue research has inspired new training approaches: Some athletes purposely
include cognitive tasks in their training (for instance, doing math problems or reactive video games
while cycling on a trainer) to train the brain to perform under mental strain. The idea is to build
tolerance to mental fatigue so that on race day, the mind can handle the distance without giving up
early. This segues nicely into our next section: how can we  hack or train  the central governor to get
more out of our performance?
Hacking the Central Governor: Strategies to Unlock Your Reserve
Capacity
If the central governor is holding you back, the million-dollar question is: Can we influence it to allow
a bit more output?  In other words, can you train your brain  or use performance tricks to access that
extra reserve your body has in the tank? The exciting answer from both science and practice is yes – to
some extent, you can “hack” the system . Keep in mind, the goal isn’t to eliminate  the governor (that
could be dangerous; we don’t actually want to push to true physical catastrophe), but to calibrate it so
it’s not needlessly conservative . Here are several evidence-based strategies to do that, presented as a
coaching guide you can apply:
1. Proper Pacing and Experience: Don’t Trigger the Alarm Too Early
One of the simplest ways to get more from your central governor is actually quite intuitive:  pace
yourself wisely . As the Marathon Handbook coaches put it, “Don’t go off too fast, too early” . If you
sprint out of the gate in a long race, you will spike all those feedback signals (heart rate, lactate, etc.)
quickly and essentially scare your central governor into action. The brain will perceive a looming threat
to homeostasis and clamp down hard – resulting in an abrupt crash or severe slowdown. Instead,
experienced endurance athletes learn to start at a controlled pace, gradually increasing effort. This way,
the brain’s alarm systems stay calmer for longer , allowing you to maintain higher output overall. It
sounds paradoxical but holding back a little initially can result in a faster total time, because you avoid
prematurely fatiguing the brain. With experience, your central governor also becomes “smarter” – it
learns from past races that you can handle a given pace for a certain distance, so it allows it. This is why
veteran marathoners often pace more evenly and finish stronger than novices who go out too hard.
Each time you successfully complete a hard effort without mishap, you’re teaching your brain
that maybe it can raise the limit a notch next time .8

Coaching tip:  During training, practice negative splits (finishing faster than you start) or progressive long
runs. This not only trains your muscles but also trains your brain to tolerate pushing at the end. You’ll
get used to the feeling of finishing hard without fear , which reassures that central governor that a
finish-line sprint won’t kill you . Over time, it may allow you to access that late-race reserve more readily
rather than locking you down.
2. Mental Training – Improve Your Brain’s Fatigue Resistance
Just as you do physical training to strengthen your body, you can do  brain endurance training  to
strengthen your mind’s resistance to fatigue. Researchers have been developing protocols often termed
“Brain Endurance Training (BET)”  or cognitive training for athletes. This usually involves combining
mental tasks with physical training. For example, after a long run, you might do 20 minutes of a
mentally challenging computer task, or vice versa, or intersperse puzzles during a bike ride. The idea is
to  repeatedly  expose  the  brain  to  fatigue  and  teach  it  to  continue  to  function.  Early  evidence  is
promising: Regularly training under mentally fatiguing conditions can increase your tolerance to
mental fatigue and reduce its impact on performance . It appears such training can actually
change how your brain networks operate – potentially making them more efficient and less prone to
the  performance  drop-offs  when  tired .  Some  studies  note  improvements  in  endurance
performance  (time-to-exhaustion  and  time-trial  results)  after  athletes  underwent  a  program  of
combined cognitive + physical training, compared to those who only did physical training.
Practical ways to implement mental training:  You don’t necessarily need fancy software. You could do
something as simple as memorizing number sequences, doing math problems in your head, or using a
brain-training app on your phone while  you’re on a stationary bike or running easy laps. Alternatively,
occasionally finish a workout, then immediately engage in a focus-intensive activity (reading dense
material, or a strategy video game, etc.) to simulate performing while mentally tired. Another accessible
method: do some key workouts when you’re already a bit mentally fatigued  (e.g., after work). This
shouldn’t  be  all  the  time  –  but  strategically  doing  so  can  teach  you  to  cope.  Just  be  cautious  to
distinguish between good  training stress and overdoing it. The goal is controlled exposure, not chronic
exhaustion.
Mental training also includes classic sports psychology techniques : visualization, goal-setting, and
self-talk . Visualization deserves a special mention. Rather than visualizing an “easy race” (which can
backfire when reality hits),  visualize yourself struggling in a race and overcoming it . Envision
that moment in the marathon at mile 20 when you are dead tired – and practice in your mind how you
will respond (engaging your posture, rhythm, positive thoughts). This kind of visualization prepares
your brain for the discomfort, almost like a mental rehearsal  of beating the central governor’s signals.
It can reduce the shock of fatigue when it actually arrives, increasing the likelihood that you’ll push
through. 
Another mental skill is developing a healthy relationship with the discomfort . If you treat the pain and
fatigue signals as information rather than suffering, you can learn to tolerate them better . Some elite
athletes are known for having a high pain tolerance – studies even show that trained athletes can
tolerate  more  pain  than  non-athletes,  likely  because  they’ve  adapted  neurologically .  You  can
cultivate this by gradually exposing yourself to hard efforts (e.g., hard interval sessions, tempo runs)
and consciously noting that you survived and perhaps even mastered the pain. The next time, it will feel
a little less intimidating.2526

3. Motivational Self-Talk and Cognitive Reframing
One  of  the  simplest  yet  most  effective  “brain  hacks”  for  performance  is  motivational  self-talk  –
deliberately using your inner voice to encourage rather than discourage. When you’re deep in a race
and your brain starts sending fatigue messages, what you tell yourself  about those messages can alter
how you feel. Instead of “I’m dying, I can’t keep this up,” if you train yourself to think “I’m okay, this is
just the effort speaking, I’ve got this,” it can actually push back the point of quitting. This isn’t just feel-
good theory; it’s backed by research. In a study where one group of endurance athletes was trained in
self-talk strategies for two weeks, that group  improved their time-to-exhaustion by a significant
margin (~18%) and reported lower RPE (effort) at sub-max times compared to a control group
. The self-talk literally made the exercise feel easier at a given intensity, which is exactly what you
want if trying to extend endurance. The researchers concluded that self-talk reduced perceived effort
and thereby allowed athletes to keep going longer . 
To apply this: come up with a few short, powerful phrases that resonate with you and that you can
remember even when very tired. Examples might be, “I am strong,” “Keep pushing forward,” “Stay
relaxed and fast,” or process-focused ones like “Powerful strides, one at a time.” The key is they should
be positive and task-relevant (not just “I feel great” when you don’t – you have to believe what you’re
saying). Practice these in training so that in races they come automatically. When that moment of doubt
and pain hits,  override it  with your prepared script. This helps divert your attention from the raw
sensations  and  reframes  them  as  manageable.  By  shifting  your  mindset,  you  alter  the  brain’s
calculation of effort vs. motivation in your favor  – the governor senses “Alright, we’re motivated to
continue, and things aren’t as dire as the pain signals alone would indicate.”
Additionally, reframe fatigue as a sign of success  rather than failure. For example, if you start hurting,
think “good, I’m reaching the productive zone, this is where the work happens” instead of panicking that
you’re slowing. This kind of cognitive reframing can improve your emotional response to fatigue and
thereby let you dig deeper .
4. Caffeine – The Chemical Override
If there’s a pharmacological secret weapon  against the central governor , it’s caffeine. Caffeine is one
of the most proven ergogenic aids (performance enhancers) in endurance sports, and much of its
power comes from central effects. How does caffeine help you push farther?  Primarily by blocking
adenosine receptors in your brain . Recall how we discussed adenosine builds up and causes
fatigue. Caffeine’s molecular structure is similar to adenosine, so it latches onto those brain receptors
and  prevents  adenosine from activating them. The result: your brain doesn’t get the “fatigue/sleepy”
signal  as  strongly,  and  it  tends  to  release  more  stimulatory  neurotransmitters  like  dopamine  and
noradrenaline. For an athlete, this means after taking caffeine, exercise feels easier – the Rating of
Perceived Exertion goes down for the same workload . You also often experience improved focus
and a mood lift, which increases motivation.
Research has consistently shown that a moderate dose of caffeine (e.g., 3–6 mg per kg body weight,
roughly 200 mg for a 70 kg person which is like a strong cup or two of coffee) can improve endurance
performance – athletes go longer or produce more power largely because the central governor’s threshold
is pushed upward . Essentially, caffeine tells the governor “we’re fine, let’s keep it going.” It  increases
central drive  (meaning your brain sends stronger signals to muscles) and reduces perceived pain and
effort . One physiological study put it succinctly: caffeine delays fatigue through CNS mechanisms,
at least in part by blocking adenosine receptors . There may be some peripheral benefits too (like
better muscle contractility or sparing glycogen by burning more fat), but the central effect is a big
contributor .31

Using caffeine as a hack should be done intelligently: you need to know your tolerance and avoid side
effects (too much can cause jitters, GI issues, or a spike-crash in energy). Generally, small amounts
taken before or during endurance exercise are beneficial for most people. Even caffeine mouth rinses
(swishing caffeine in your mouth and spitting it out) have shown some performance benefit in studies,
suggesting just the detection of caffeine by oral receptors might signal the brain and produce some
effect (though that’s less pronounced than actual ingestion) . 
Coaching note:  If you’re not caffeine-habituated (regular user), its effects will be stronger . If you are, you
might need a slightly higher dose or to cycle off occasionally. Always test in training first; don’t try a new
caffeine strategy for the first time on race day (everyone’s sensitivity is a bit different). And remember ,
while caffeine can make you feel less tired, it doesn’t make you invincible – you still must respect pacing
and hydration, as caffeine is a diuretic and stimulant that can raise heart rate. It simply gives you a
nudge to override some of the brain’s fatigue signals.
5. Carbohydrate Mouth Rinse – Trick the Brain’s Fuel Sensors
Here’s a neat trick that shows how clever  and central some performance hacks are: rinsing your mouth
with a carbohydrate solution  (like a sports drink) then spitting it out. Common sense would say if you
don’t swallow it, it shouldn’t help performance, right? Yet, studies have found that in events around an
hour in length, athletes who rinse their mouths with a carb solution can perform better (run or cycle
longer/faster) even without ingesting it. How? It appears that  receptors in the mouth detect the
presence of carbohydrates and send a signal to the brain’s reward and motor-control centers ,
basically telling your brain “energy is on the way!” . The brain, upon sensing this, often reduces the
sensation of effort and permits a higher intensity for a time. It’s like giving your central governor
reassurance that fuel is coming, so it can loosen the reins a bit. Imaging studies have shown activation
in reward-related brain areas during carb rinsing . 
For athletes who, for example, are doing a fasted morning run or a short time trial where they don’t
want a full stomach, this hack can give a boost without actual caloric intake. It essentially exploits the
central governor’s responsiveness to nutritional status signals  – fooling it into thinking “we’ve got
glucose available, keep firing those muscles!” 
Of course, in longer events, you will need to actually ingest carbs to avoid genuine peripheral fuel
depletion. But even then, the sooner the brain knows fuel is coming, the better . This is partly why taking
a sports drink or gel early in a marathon (even before you need  it) can help – not just for the fuel later ,
but immediately to the brain. 
6. Training in Adverse Conditions (Safely) – Expanding Your Governor’s Comfort
Zone
Another way to raise the ceiling on your central governor is to train occasionally in tougher-than-normal
conditions so the “normal” feels easier by comparison. This includes things like heat training, altitude
training, or deconditioned-state training . For example, training in high heat acclimatizes you – not
only do your muscles adapt (like increased plasma volume, etc.), but your brain also adapts to working
with higher core temperatures. It raises the threshold at which it will say “too hot, slow down.” Indeed,
after heat acclimation, athletes can perform better in both hot and cool conditions because their central
tolerance  for  heat  stress  is  improved  (and  peripheral  adaptations  help  cooling).  Similarly,  altitude
training  might  improve  how  your  brain  deals  with  low  oxygen  signals.  These  are  more  advanced
techniques and need to be done carefully to avoid heat stroke or altitude sickness. But the principle is:
controlled exposure to environmental stressors in training can push the central governor to
recalibrate . 35

Even something as simple as occasionally finishing a long run dehydrated  (within safe limits) can train
your brain and body to handle low fluid, so in a race if you’re slightly dehydrated it doesn’t trigger as
strong a slowdown. Again, caution is key – always prioritize safety and gradual adaptation with any such
stress.
7. Building Pain Tolerance with High-Intensity Training
We touched on this under mental training, but let’s emphasize physical high-intensity interval training
(HIIT) or very hard workouts as a central governor hack. When you do repeated sprints, hill repeats, or
hard intervals, you are deliberately pushing to the point of severe discomfort. Besides all the great
physiological benefits (VO₂ max improvements, lactate clearance, muscle recruitment, etc.), you are
teaching your central nervous system that you can survive bursts of near-max effort . Athletes
who incorporate these “painful” sessions often develop a higher tolerance – the central governor learns
that what used to be “emergency high pain” is now tolerable. One suggestion from coaches is: when you
think you truly can’t do another rep, try to do it anyway (safely) . That extra rep when you’re at your
limit is pure gold for mental toughness  – it’s basically you proving to your brain “see, we had a bit
more!” Come race day, that memory might allow you to push through a rough patch instead of giving
up.
A study in Frontiers in Psychology  (2020) even noted differences in pain processing between elite athletes
and non-athletes, indicating that training can alter how the brain perceives and responds to pain signals
. If pain is perceived as less threatening, the central governor will not intervene as quickly.
Of  course,  incorporate  adequate  recovery.  The  goal  is  to  flirt  with  your  limits,  not  to  chronically
overreach which can actually lower your fatigue resistance if you’re always exhausted. 
8. External Motivators and Competition
Ever  noticed  how  you  can  dig  deeper  when  you’re  racing  someone  or  have  a  cheering  crowd ,
compared to training alone? Social and environmental factors can also “hack” the central governor .
Competition boosts adrenaline and motivation, which can partly suppress fatigue signals. The presence
of a rival can distract you from internal sensations (a form of dissociation) or push you to endure more
to not let them beat you. The brain essentially raises its allowable output when stakes or social factors
are high – an evolutionary trait perhaps (think of running for survival; you’d find another gear). 
As a self-hack, you can simulate this by occasionally training with a partner who is slightly faster , or by
joining  a  group/club  where  friendly  competition  drives  you  on.  Likewise,  even  music  is  a  known
performance enhancer: the right upbeat music can reduce perceived exertion and improve endurance,
likely by improving mood and diverting attention from fatigue. It’s not exactly central governor “off
switch,” but it can extend the time before the fatigue signals dominate your mind. Many athletes have a
power song or playlist for tough parts of workouts – use that tool if it works for you.
9. Mindfulness and Focus Techniques
This  might  seem  contradictory  to  using  dissociation  (music,  distraction),  but  another  approach  is
mindfulness – training yourself to accept and observe fatigue sensations without panic . This is
more of an advanced mental strategy: instead of ignoring the pain, you face it calmly. Runners who use
mindful approach might do a body scan while running, relaxing areas of tension, focusing on breath,
and not attaching fear or frustration to the feeling of fatigue. By doing so, they prevent the mental
anguish that often accompanies pain (“Oh no, I’m dying, I hate this”) which actually intensifies the
perception of effort. Mindfulness can reduce anxiety and keep your prefrontal cortex (the rational part)39
40

engaged, which can modulate the alarm signals from deeper brain regions. Some studies suggest
mindfulness training can improve pain tolerance and endurance by changing your relationship to the
discomfort – essentially making the central governor’s warnings less threatening.
10. Ensure Physical Needs Are Met  (So the Brain Doesn’t Panic)
Lastly, a very practical way to keep your central governor lenient is to  manage the physical factors
that feed into it . This isn’t hacking the brain directly , but by optimizing things like nutrition, hydration,
and cooling, you give the central governor less reason to clamp down. For example:
Stay hydrated and cool in hot conditions:  If your brain senses skyrocketing body temperature
or dehydration (which thickens the blood and strains the heart), it will intervene. Wearing cooling
vests before a race, pouring water on your head, drinking cold fluids, or simply acclimating to
heat will raise the threshold at which heat signals become limiting. Your brain then allows more
work before calling it quits.
Fuel properly for long events:  Low blood sugar is a major trigger for the brain to shut you
down (to preserve glucose for the brain itself, ironically). Taking in carbohydrates during races
ensures your brain sees a stable fuel supply and doesn’t hit the brakes to save itself. Even when
your muscles might still have glycogen, a dip in blood glucose can make you  feel exhausted
(central fatigue via the brain). So maintaining nutrition is partly a central governor hack – it keeps
the brain in a fed, happier state.
Taper and rest:  A well-rested brain (and body) will always perform better . If you go into a race
already somewhat fatigued, your governor is already on alert. Proper tapering (reducing training
load before a big race) isn’t just muscle recovery – it’s letting your whole central nervous system
recharge.  Fresh  neurotransmitters,  full  glycogen  stores  in  the  brain  and  muscles,  balanced
hormones – these set you up to have a high “safety limit” on race day.
By taking care of these basics, you prevent prematurely activating your body’s defense mechanisms.
The central governor is like an overprotective parent – the less it sees to worry about, the more freedom
it will give you.
In summary, hacking the central governor comes down to two broad approaches: (a) changing
your perception  of effort and (b) increasing your motivation  or willingness to endure.  Most of the
strategies  above  attack  one  or  both  of  those  angles.  If  perceived  effort  is  lower  (due  to  self-talk,
caffeine, music, etc.), you can sustain a higher intensity for longer before the alarm bells ring . If
your motivation or emotional drive is higher (due to competition, goal-setting, etc.), you can also push
further despite the discomfort. Ideally, you combine both – feel the effort slightly less  and care a lot
about pushing through what you do feel.
It’s important to hack the central governor responsibly . Remember , it exists for a reason – to stop you
from truly harming yourself. The goal of extending your limits isn’t to run yourself into medical trouble;
it’s to explore the gap between what is comfortable and what is physiologically dangerous, and shrink
the margin of error (the “governor’s buffer”) safely as your training progresses. By understanding and
applying these techniques, you can often find that you are capable of more than you once thought. That
extra 1% or 5% might be the difference between a new personal record and a plateau.•

Conclusion: Mind and Body – The Dual Frontier of Endurance
Endurance performance isn’t just a test of muscle and heart – it’s equally a test of the mind.  Tim
Noakes’ Central Governor Theory reminds us that our brains  play a pivotal role in deciding where
our limits lie , acting out of an ancient biological wisdom to protect us from ourselves . We’ve
learned that the brain can indeed be a limiting factor – imposing fatigue to safeguard homeostasis –
but also that it can be influenced and trained. The distinction between peripheral and central fatigue
underscores that while we must train our bodies (through miles, intervals, and strength work), we must
also train our brains and leverage our psychology. A well-conditioned athlete with a poorly managed
mental game might underperform compared to a slightly less fit athlete with fierce mental resilience.
Practically, this means incorporating mental strategies into your training routine just as routinely as you
do  physical  workouts.  It  means  recognizing  when  your  perceived  limitations  are  more  negotiable
(“central”) versus non-negotiable (“peripheral”). If you feel like you absolutely  cannot go on, it might just
be your brain’s first line of defense – and perhaps you actually can go further with the right approach.
As the examples and studies showed, you likely have a reserve: many marathoners can surge at the
end, mentally fresh athletes outperform tired ones even with the same muscles, and a bit of self-belief
can literally extend your endurance by measurable margins .
For  runners  and  coaches,  embracing  the  central  governor  concept  opens  up  new  avenues  for
performance  gains.  It  shifts  some  focus  to  recovery  for  the  brain  (sleep,  mental  breaks) , 
psychological preparation , and  creative workout design  that challenges your mental fortitude. It
validates the use of sport psychology techniques – these are not just pep talks; they are tools to
modulate your brain’s control over your body. And when you toe the start line, it might help to know
that the pain you’ll feel is not a direct indicator that you’re at your limit – it’s a suggestion from your
brain that you could  be approaching a limit. How you interpret and react to that suggestion determines
what happens next. 
Always remember , though: the central governor is on your  side  in the grand scheme – it wants to keep
you safe so you can race another day. The goal is to form a partnership with it. Through training, you
reassure your brain that you are safe to perform at a high level. Through experience, you negotiate with
the governor for a little more leeway. Through strategy, you distract it or convince it to hold off a bit
longer . And through care, you ensure it’s well-rested and fueled so it stays calm. 
In closing, the interplay of brain and body defines the art of endurance training. By applying the science
– from Noakes’ pioneering ideas to the latest findings on mental fatigue – you can become a more
resilient athlete. You’ll know why you sometimes falter and, more importantly, how to overcome it. Next
time you feel like you can’t possibly continue, you’ll have an array of tools to tap into: a mantra to recite,
a sip of sports drink to swish, a memory of all the times you pushed through in practice, maybe a dose
of caffeine in your system, and the knowledge that yes, there is likely more in the tank. Bit by bit, you’ll
stretch the boundaries of your endurance. As the famous quote by Roger Bannister goes, “The great
barrier is the mental hurdle.” Overcoming that hurdle is an ongoing process, but with each step forward
in mental strength, you’ll find new personal bests on the roads and trails . Good luck, and train both
smart  and strong  – with your brain and body working in harmony to achieve your goals.

 “The  central  governor …  controls  physical  activity  so  intensity  cannot  threaten  the  body's
homeostasis… It limits exercise by reducing neural recruitment of muscle fibers, causing the sensation
of fatigue .”
 “The peripheral fatigue model predicts exercise terminates only after catastrophic failure… and
all motor units recruited. Marathoners, however , pace themselves anticipating conditions (heat, course
difficulty) and can even increase pace near the finish. They finish races without evidence of catastrophic
homeostasis failure or absolute fatigue (not all motor units recruited). These findings are best explained
by a central (brain) control that regulates performance in anticipation to prevent harm .”
 “According to the Central Governor Model… if the brain senses exercise is reaching a dangerous
level (too far , too fast, too little fuel), it acts to decrease intensity. In the peripheral model, burning
quads are due to local factors (acid buildup). In the CG model, that ‘burn’ is a result of the brain
reducing muscle fiber recruitment  in the quads .”
 “CNS  fatigue  can  be  defined  as  a  decrease  in  voluntary  activation  of  muscles  –  a  drop  in
motoneuron firing frequency & sync, and reduced motor cortex drive. Peripheral fatigue is a decrease in
muscle fibers’ contractile strength with changes in muscle action potential transmission mechanisms
.”
 “After a 90-min cognitive task, subjects were mentally fatigued and their time to exhaustion in
cycling at 80% peak power was significantly reduced (~640s vs 754s control, p=0.003). This negative
effect was  not due to cardiorespiratory or muscle metabolic factors – those were largely unchanged.
However ,  mentally  fatigued  subjects  rated  their  perception  of  effort  higher  during  exercise  and
reached maximal perceived exertion sooner , leading them to disengage earlier . Conclusion:
mental  fatigue  limits  exercise  tolerance  through  higher  perceived  effort,  rather  than  physiological
impairment.”
 “It is speculated that engaging in a cognitive task induces accumulation of  adenosine in the
anterior cingulate cortex , generating a greater sense of effort in subsequent tasks. This is based on
studies showing sustained attention tasks strongly activate the anterior cingulate (involved in effort
perception) and that increased neural activation elevates extracellular adenosine, which is associated
with decreased performance .”•
