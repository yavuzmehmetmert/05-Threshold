Neuromuscular Running Drills and Technique
Analysis
Drill Taxonomy & Purpose
Overview:  Running  drills  are  fundamental  exercises  used  to  reinforce  proper  biomechanics,  build
specific  strength,  and  develop  neuromuscular  coordination  for  efficient  running  form .  The
classic “A-B-C” drill series, popularized by coach Gerard Mach in the 1970s, remains widely used by
coaches today for these purposes . Below is a taxonomy of key drills, each with its biomechanical
focus and execution cues:
A-Skip & A-March (High Knee Drill)
Purpose:  The  A-skip  (and  its  slower  counterpart  A-march)  emphasizes  front-side  mechanics  –  an
exaggerated  knee drive  followed by an active foot strike directly under the center of mass. It trains
upright posture, coordinated arm-leg motion, and strengthens the hip flexors and quads through a
high knee lift . A-skips promote an efficient foot strike with minimal ground contact time and
optimal knee lift , while allowing full range of motion at the hips . Essentially, this drill teaches
runners to “lift the knees, then drive the feet down”  rather than reaching forward.
Execution Cues:  From a skip-like bouncing rhythm,  lift one thigh to parallel  (hip height) with  toe
dorsiflexed (“toe up”) , then “paw” the foot down  aggressively, landing on the ball of the foot directly
under the body’s center of gravity . The cue “knees up, feet down”  is often used – the knee comes
up, and then the foot punches down under the hips  with the ankle dorsiflexed for a midfoot strike .
Keeping the toes up (avoiding early plantarflexion) ensures a stiff ankle at contact and better force
application . The athlete should feel a quick bounce off the ground  rather than a shuffle. Arm swing
is coordinated in opposition to leg drive (as in normal running). Good posture is crucial: hips tall and
slightly forward  (a slight forward lean) so that the foot doesn’t reach out in front . If the athlete is
too upright, the foot may land too far forward; a bit of forward lean helps the foot land in the “sweet
spot” beneath the hips  for optimal ground force .
Biomechanical Benefit:  A-skips reinforce front-side mechanics and rhythmic  neuromuscular firing
patterns  for sprinting. They teach the feeling of driving down into the ground beneath the body, which
can translate to less overstriding and better use of the glutes and hamstrings in running. In fact,
practicing A-skips has been shown to encourage foot strikes under the center of gravity and activate the
posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, calves) for a more powerful stride . While A-skips are relatively
low-intensity, they serve as a specific strengthening drill and warm-up that “grooves” proper running
form . Coaching tip:  Before doing them at full speed, do a slower A-march  to master the mechanics.
A-march is simply the A-skip done as a march (no bounce) to focus on form.
Common Errors to Avoid:  Not applying enough downward force (a weak foot strike) and staying too
upright are common mistakes . Athletes sometimes point their toes down  (plantarflex) during the
skip – this is incorrect, as it delays effective contact; instead, the foot should stay flexed up (toes up)
until hitting the ground . Also avoid trying to cover too much ground with each skip – the goal is12

rhythm and vertical force, not forward distance. Speed of execution should come after mastering the
correct timing and posture.
B-Skip (Foreleg Extension Drill)
Purpose:  The B-skip is a progression of the A-skip that adds a  foreleg extension and paw-back
motion  to the high-knee cycle. It was designed to drill the “active clawing”  of the foot back under the
hips,  which  mimics  the  recovery  phase  of  sprinting  when  the  lower  leg  extends  and  then  pulls
backward  just  before  ground  contact.  The  B-skip  particularly  targets  hamstring  activation  and
eccentric strength , as the hamstrings must control the forward swing and then initiate the backward
pull. Done correctly, it teaches athletes to  strike the ground with a bent knee under the body
(preventing overstriding) and to apply backward force. In other words, it emphasizes a powerful paw-
back  to create propulsion instead of a passive landing.
Execution Cues:  Begin like an A-skip: drive the knee up  with toes up. At the top of the knee lift, extend
the lower leg forward  (as if kicking out) then immediately whip the foot back and down  (“claw” it
back) to land on the ball of the foot beneath the hips . Coaches often say  “lead with the heel”
during the extension and then “scratch the ground”  as you pull back. The landing should feel active, with
the foot moving backward upon contact (as opposed to stabbing straight down). Maintain dorsal flexion
(toes up) during the cycle to ensure a midfoot/forefoot strike under the body . Keep the posture tall
and core engaged as in A-skip. Essentially, a B-skip is “A-skip + leg reach + paw-back.”
Why It’s Often Done Wrong:  B-skips are notoriously performed poorly by athletes who flick their lower
leg out without the proper paw-back. A lazy B-skip looks like a mere forward flick of the foot (“lazy flicks”
as  some  coaches  say)  with  no  forceful  backward  drive .  This  is  counterproductive  and  can
encourage  overstriding  or  even  strain  the  hamstring  if  done  carelessly.  The  key  is  separating  the
motions: thigh up, then lower leg extend, then immediately pull back . Many coaches avoid B-skips
because athletes struggle with that coordination and may  “cast out” the leg excessively , increasing
injury risk . However , when done properly, the drill teaches control of the swing leg and strong foot
strikes. Focus on the paw-back:  the moment the leg extends, snap it down under you. Leading with
the heel  (heel slightly up) helps maintain a cyclical motion and ensures you land on the ball of the foot,
not the heel .
Biomechanical Benefit:  B-skips reinforce the concept that a high knee lift must be followed by an
active drive down and back. This drill can improve an athlete’s  frontside mechanics transition into
backside push-off . It builds specific strength in hip flexors (lifting the leg) and hamstrings (pulling
back). For sprinters, hurdlers, and jumpers, it replicates aspects of their events – for example, hurdlers
and triple jumpers often extend the leg and then claw  back under them in their actual movements .
Including B-skips in training can increase confidence in hamstring strength and resilience because the
drill, done right, involves controlled eccentric and concentric hamstring work . Coaching note:  Ensure
the athlete has mastered A-skips before introducing B-skips – if their A-skip form is funky, adding the
complexity of B-skip will likely cause more harm than good .
Straight-Leg Bounds (aka “Prime Times” or Scissor Runs)
Purpose:  Straight-leg bounds are a dynamic drill used to develop ankle stiffness, reactive strength,
and  hamstring–glute  power  in  a  running  context.  In  this  drill,  the  athlete  bounds  forward  with
minimal knee bend , using a straight (or slightly unlocked) leg to strike the ground. This action teaches
the athlete to apply force through the hip (glutes) and hamstrings  while keeping the ankle joint stiff –
closely  mimicking  the  high-speed  running  posture  where  the  leg  is  relatively  straight  at  ground
contact and the hips drive the motion . The drill reinforces quick ground contact and elasticity in the1112

lower legs, training the stretch-shortening cycle at the ankle. It’s often described as feeling like a
springy, stiff-legged run – which can enhance sprint speed and resilience to injury by strengthening the
posterior chain in a specific range of motion.
Execution Cues:  Assume a slight forward lean with hips tall. Begin a series of skipping or bounding
steps without actively bending the knees  – legs remain almost straight  (about 10-15° of knee bend)
and land on the midfoot/ball of foot. Emphasize striking the ground  under the center of mass  and
popping off quickly. Key cues include: “Kick down, not forward,” “toes up”  (keep ankles dorsiflexed), and
“lead with the heel”  on each stride to ensure the foot is ready for a flat, powerful contact . The
movement looks somewhat like a stiff, bouncing stride , where each contact is quick and each swing
leg only lifts to about 45° in front. Arms swing naturally as in running. Maintain an upright torso (avoid
leaning back). The focus is on vertical force and quick rebounding  – let the ground contact propel
you forward  rather than trying to reach out. 
Common Errors:  Because this drill can feel awkward, a few typical errors occur and should be corrected
:
Excessive backward lean:  Some athletes lean back and stick their legs out front, resembling a
“Looney Tunes frog” posture . This is wrong; instead, keep a slight forward lean so the foot
strikes under or slightly behind the hip.
Going for speed over form:  Athletes often try to do straight-leg bounds too “quick” with tiny,
rapid steps. That can defeat the purpose. It’s better to ensure each contact is strong and under
the hip  – quality over frequency . Do not rush the drill; feel the “pop” off the ground  from each
stride .
Insufficient leg lift:  Not lifting the swinging leg to ~45° at the hip. A modest front-side lift
(about halfway up) is needed to prepare for a downward strike; if the leg stays too low, the
athlete ends up shuffling without bounce .
Pointing the toes (plantarflexing) in the air:  This is a big no-no as it leads to a sloppy foot
contact. Athletes must keep the ankle locked at 90° (toes up toward shin)  so that when the
foot meets the ground, it’s in a power position. Cue: Imagine pulling your toes toward your shin
on each stride . Leading downward with the heel can help enforce this, but actual contact
should be close to a flat foot (midfoot/forefoot) strike .
By avoiding these errors, the drill will correctly teach the hamstrings and glutes to apply force into
the ground  with short contact times . 
Biomechanical Benefit:  Straight-leg bounds train the athlete to be explosive without relying on deep
knee bend , thus isolating the hip extensors (glutes, hamstrings) and ankle stiffness. This can translate
to more forceful pushoff in running and improved leg stiffness  at foot strike, which is associated with
greater  running  economy  and  speed.  Coaches  note  that  this  drill  is  great  for  developing  elastic
strength  in the hamstrings and minimizing ground contact time at top speeds . In fact, straight-leg
bounding is a staple for many sprint groups because it strengthens the specific musculature and
movements used in maximal velocity running, potentially contributing to faster times and reduced
injury risk . Additionally, because it mimics some aspects of sprinting (but at lower velocity), it’s a
safe way to introduce sprint-like stimulus  in early season or general prep phases when athletes are
not ready for full-speed work . Many coaches use straight-leg bounds during warm-ups or  early
training phases  to build a base of elastic strength, and also occasionally in special endurance workouts
(e.g. as a “finisher” after a hard run to reinforce mechanics under fatigue) .21

Carioca / Lateral Shuffle Drills
Figure: Athletes performing a  Carioca drill , shuffling laterally with a crossover step. Lateral drills like this
engage the hips and core in ways that straight-ahead running does not.
Purpose:  Most running drills occur in the sagittal (forward) plane, but  carioca drills move in the
frontal (side-to-side) plane . Carioca (also known as the grapevine drill) involves a sideways shuffle
where the legs alternately cross in front and behind. The purpose is to break the monotony of strictly
forward motion , activating the hip abductors/adductors, gluteus medius, and core stabilizers that
often get neglected in linear running . By training lateral and rotational movement, carioca drills
improve coordination , agility , and balance , and help runners develop a more well-rounded strength
profile. They are especially useful for engaging the muscles around the hips and glutes (the “stabilizers”)
which provide stability and prevent excessive pelvis drop or knee valgus during running . In short,
lateral drills address muscle imbalances from always moving forward, potentially reducing injury risk
and improving overall running form.
Execution Cues:  Stand sideways and begin moving laterally with a cross-step pattern . The trailing leg
steps over and in front  of the leading leg, then the next step brings the now trailing leg behind  the
other – in a repeating “over-under” weave. One common teaching sequence for carioca is:
Athletic stance:  slight bend in knees, core engaged. Arms can be held out at shoulder height or
in a running arm swing pattern.
Cross behind:  Push off the lead foot, step the trailing foot behind and across  the front leg,
shifting weight onto it .
Step side:  Move the original lead foot sideways so feet are apart again .
Cross in front:  Now take the same trailing foot and cross in front of the other leg , lifting the
knee a bit as you do so, then plant it down .
Repeat:  Continue this braiding footwork for the length of the drill (typically 15–30 meters), then
reverse direction.
Keep the hips and shoulders facing forward (or gently swiveling) – don’t completely turn your body
sideways, as the goal is a coordinated twist of the torso and hips. Arm movement:  Either hold arms out
to sides for balance or perform an exaggerated arm swing horizontally (some coaches have athletes
swing their arms in opposition to foot crossover to simulate trunk rotation and balance). Focus on a
smooth, rhythmic crossover  rather than speed. As coordination improves, increase quickness while
maintaining form. 
Muscles & Benefits:  The carioca engages the  core and hip musculature  significantly. Crossing the
legs forces your  glutes, hip flexors, and adductors/abductors  to work through an extended range,
improving  mobility.  It  strengthens  the  lateral  hip  stabilizers  (gluteus  medius,  TFL)  which  helps  in
preventing injuries like IT band syndrome or knee valgus collapse by improving hip stability during
running . Moreover , moving in the frontal plane teaches the body to better handle side-to-side
forces – an important aspect for trail runners or any athlete who might need to dodge or move laterally
. It can improve proprioception and agility, possibly saving an athlete from missteps or rolled ankles
by improving lateral quickness and balance .
Breaking Sagittal Dominance:  Runners spend most of their time moving forward, so the muscles that
control lateral motion can become underdeveloped. Training with lateral drills like carioca “strengthens
the lateral muscles, which prevents excessive sideways movement as you move forward” , thereby
enforcing proper alignment even in forward running . In other words, a stronger lateral chain keeps
your form tight (less wobble) in the sagittal plane. Studies and coaches emphasize that frontal plane30

training actually  supports  and improves forward running performance by correcting imbalances .
Runners who incorporate such drills often report feeling more “athletic” and stable.
When/How to Use:  Carioca is commonly used as a  dynamic warm-up drill , preparing the hips and
legs for activity. It can be done over ~20 meters down and back. It’s also a fun coordination challenge
for athletes, improving footwork. Variations include high-knee carioca (adding an exaggerated knee lift
during the crossover) and carioca with an agility ladder (to increase speed and precision). These can
further challenge coordination once basic carioca is mastered .
Ground Contact Time (GCT) Minimization
When it comes to running fast and efficiently,  ground contact time (GCT)  – the duration your foot
spends on the ground each step – is a critical factor . Sprinters at top speed have incredibly short GCT
(on the order of 0.09–0.12 seconds in elite sprinters) because they are applying explosive force in a very
brief instant . For distance runners, a moderately short contact time can also improve running
economy by reducing braking forces. Plyometric drills are a primary tool to train the body to apply high
force in minimal time , thereby reducing GCT. Additionally, neuromuscular techniques like muscle pre-
activation  (pre-tensing)  help  prepare  the  leg  for  efficient,  spring-like  contacts.  This  section  covers
specific drills to reduce ground contact time and the science of pre-tensing muscles before impact.
Plyometric Drills for Reducing GCT
Pogo Jumps (Ankle Hops): Pogos  are a simple yet highly effective drill to train quick ground contacts. In
a pogo jump, one keeps the knees nearly locked and bounces off the balls of the feet, using mainly the
ankle joint  like a spring (imagine the motion of a pogo stick). The goal is to achieve  ultra-short
contact times (on the order of 0.15–0.18 seconds) with each hop , emphasizing the stretch-
shortening cycle in the Achilles tendon and calf muscles. This drill teaches the concept of “stiffness”  –
the ability to resist collapse and rebound quickly. Athletes should focus on springy, bouncy rebounds  off
the ground with minimal knee bend and heels barely kissing (or not touching) the ground. Cue:  think
“hot ground”  (don’t let your feet stay on the ground – get off it as fast as possible). Pogo jumps train
fast-twitch recruitment and lower-leg stiffness  specifically , which directly translates to reduced
ground contact in running. They are often done in place or for short distances, in sets of 10–30 hops.
Because of the high elastic demand, keep volume reasonable to maintain quality.
Depth Jumps / Drop Jumps:  Depth jumps are a classic plyometric exercise aimed at extreme reactivity.
In a depth jump, the athlete steps off a box or platform and upon landing immediately rebounds
upward  (or forward, depending on the variation). This exercise creates a high impact force that, if
utilized quickly, generates a powerful concentric jump via the stretch-shortening cycle. To specifically
train for short GCT, coaches use the drop jump  variant: using a relatively low box (20–60 cm), the athlete
drops down and focuses on minimal knee bend and minimal contact time on the ground  before
springing up . In fact, drop jumps are defined by their “instant” reversal  – think of bouncing a ball;
the goal is a quick bounce, not a deep squat. A well-executed drop jump will have the athlete land
almost stiff-legged  (though safely) and explode upward with ground contacts well under 0.25s . Track &
field coaches often prescribe low altitude drop jumps precisely to mimic the brief ground contact of
sprinting, sometimes even cueing athletes to land  “flat-footed” and stiff  to replicate the full-foot
contact in maximal velocity running while still keeping the contact very short . Research supports
that such fast-reactive plyometrics (<0.2s contact)  maximize utilization of elastic energy and reactive
strength .39

For more advanced athletes, depth jumps can also be done from higher boxes with a focus on jump
height (which inherently lengthens ground contact); however , those are geared toward power more
than pure GCT reduction. For GCT training, lower boxes and strict technique  (minimal sink on landing)
are preferred. One guideline is to choose a box height at which the athlete can land and rebound
without a noticeable delay  – if contact time starts to drag out or the athlete has to sink too low, the
box is too high . Using a contact mat or timer can help monitor the exact GCT and ensure the
athlete is staying in the reactive (<0.25s) zone.
Additional Plyos:  Other drills that specifically train quick contacts include hurdle hops  (serial bouncing
over  low  hurdles  with  minimal  ground  time) ,  skipping  or  running  in  place  with  very  high
frequency  (to a metronome), and even technical sprint drills like the A-skip when done very fast. The
key across all these exercises is the intent: prioritize a short amortization phase  (coupling time). The
muscles and tendons should act like a stiff spring – load and explode. Plyometric training organized by
ground  contact  profiles  shows  that  certain  drills  target  this  reactive  quality:  for  example,  in  one
categorization, pogo jumps and low hurdle hops were in the “fast reactive” category (<0.20s), while
more strength-oriented jumps had longer contacts . By selecting the right drills, coaches can
specifically train athletes to be reactive.
Result:  Through consistent practice of these plyos, athletes can significantly improve their reactive
strength index (jump height divided by contact time) – essentially learning to produce more force in less
time. This carries over to running as shorter ground contact times and higher stride frequencies ,
since the legs can now cycle faster without losing force. It’s important to note, however , that these drills
should be done when fresh and with full focus on quality; once fatigue sets in, contact times will
increase and the training switches to a different stimulus . Coaches often stop the set once they
observe the athlete’s contacts getting slower or sloppier – that ensures every rep trains the desired
quality.
Muscle “Pre-Tension” Before Impact (The Science of Pre-Activation)
One often overlooked aspect of minimizing ground contact time is what happens just before the foot
hits the ground . Elite sprinters intuitively activate (tense) certain muscles in anticipation of contact – a
feed-forward mechanism that stiffens joints and prepares the leg spring to compress and rebound
instantly. This concept is known as muscle pre-activation or “pre-tensing.”  Essentially, by tensing the
muscles at just the right moment before impact, the athlete can  hit the ground already stiff and
prepared to push off , rather than absorbing too much and lagging on the ground. 
What  is  Pre-Tension?  In  technical  terms,  “pre-tension  is  a  combination  of  muscle  recruitment  before
landing and a rapid switch from relaxation to stiffening right before foot contact.” . In practice, it means
as the foot is swinging forward about to land, key muscles like the hamstrings, quads, and calf begin
contracting  milliseconds  early to brace for impact. For example, EMG studies show that the vastus
medialis (a quadriceps muscle) fires ~30 milliseconds before foot strike  in sprinting  – essentially
the body anticipating ground contact by stiffening the knee. Similarly, the hamstrings (which decelerate
the  forward  swing  and  help  stiffen  the  knee)  and  calf  muscles  (which  lock  the  ankle)  have  high
activation before and at the moment of impact  in well-trained runners . This pre-activation means
the leg behaves like a pre-loaded spring on contact, storing elastic energy and rebounding quickly,
rather than like a loose shock absorber which would compress slowly.
Training Pre-Activation:  While some amount of pre-tension is reflexive in skilled athletes, it can be
enhanced through drills and cues. Plyometric exercises inherently train this – for instance, low box hops
and rhythm hops force the athlete to develop an early tension before each landing, or they simply won’t
rebound quickly. A coach can cue an athlete during drills like pogos or hurdle hops to  “anticipate the4849

ground”  or “stay stiff.”  Over time, the athlete learns the feeling of contracting the calves/quads just prior
to ground contact  for an optimal rebound. One coach’s findings using fine-wire EMG noted that some
non-elite athletes “relax too much and have delayed contraction times” , whereas elite performers
switch on at the right instant . Drills that involve surprise or quick response, like dropping off a low
box  and  reacting,  can  induce  the  neuromuscular  system  to  activate  sooner .  Additionally,  strength
training exercises that emphasize rapid switching from eccentric to concentric (like drop catches, or
catching Olympic lifts) may help.
Cueing Dorsiflexion:  A very practical cue related to pre-tension is keeping the ankle dorsiflexed  (toes
up) as the foot approaches the ground. This is hammered in form drills – e.g., the A-skip cue “toe up” –
because a dorsiflexed ankle means the calf is active and the Achilles is pre-loaded for contact . If the
foot is allowed to dangle or plantarflex, the Achilles slackens and the foot will slap down, increasing
contact time. By contrast, a stiff ankle joint at landing behaves like a spring (and also usually lands
closer to beneath the body). So, a universal tip for runners: before contact, pull your toes up  – this
naturally aids pre-activation of the lower leg.
Benefits:  Mastering pre-tension can significantly reduce the amortization phase  (the time where the
muscular-tendon unit is transitioning from loading to push-off). As one coach put it,  “you’re not just
leaving the floor – you’re bouncing off it.”  With proper pre-activation, the athlete can hit the ground
and  rebound  with  minimal  delay,  effectively  leveraging  elastic  energy.  This  not  only  improves
performance (speed, jump height) but can also reduce injury risk because the  load is absorbed by
tensed muscle-tendon units  rather than by collapsing joints or passive structures. In sprinting, strong
pre-activation of the hamstrings just before footstrike is thought to protect the hamstrings from strain
by stiffening them at the critical moment of ground contact (when they’re stretched and loaded).
It should be noted that there’s an optimal level of tension – athletes should not be rigid too early or they
waste energy and lose fluidity. The idea is a rapid switch from relaxed flight to stiff support  at the last
split-second . This timing is a skill developed with practice. According to anecdotal evidence, even
just  8–15  foot  contacts  per  leg  in  a  drill,  for  3–5  sets ,  a  couple  of  times  a  week,  can  yield
improvements in an athlete’s ability to pre-tense and react . The scientific research on training pre-
activation is still emerging (it’s “scant” in literature) , but coaches’ practical results and fundamental
biomechanics support its importance. If an athlete can learn to  “increase the relaxation to pre-tension
rate”  – meaning switch from loose to tight faster – they will achieve shorter contacts . 
In summary, minimizing GCT is not just about pushing hard; it’s about hitting the ground prepared .
Through plyometrics and conscious practice, runners can develop a muscle pre-tensing ability that,
combined with strength and technique, leads to light, explosive steps.
Cadence & Stride Mechanics
Efficient running isn’t only about how forcefully you push off, but also how you cycle your legs and
where they land relative to your center of mass . Two major aspects of stride mechanics are stride
length vs. cadence (step frequency)  and the tendency of some runners to overstride  (land with feet
too far forward). Neuromuscular drills and cues can help correct overstriding and improve cadence
without significantly increasing energy cost, thereby improving running economy and reducing injury
risk.57

Correcting Overstriding (Avoiding Braking Forces)
What is Overstriding?  Overstriding is a form flaw where a runner’s foot lands in front of their center
of gravity  (often with the knee excessively straight), rather than beneath it. This is commonly seen as a
heel strike far forward, and it creates a braking force  – essentially the foot is hitting the ground in front
and pulling the body to a stop momentarily . Overstriding not only slows a runner down, but also
increases  impact  on  the  joints  (hip,  knee,  ankle)  because  the  ground  reaction  force  is  directed
backwards against the motion. Ideal running form has the foot contacting close to under the hips
(center of mass) with the shin vertical or lightly angled, reducing braking and allowing a smoother
rollover .
Drills and Techniques to Fix Overstriding:
Increase Forward Lean:  Runners who overstride often run upright or even leaning back. By
adopting a  very slight forward lean from the ankles (~8–10°) , you encourage your foot to land
closer  under  you .  Essentially,  if  your  body  “falls”  forward,  your  foot  must  catch  up
underneath. A cue is to imagine running tall but with hips forward and chest ever so slightly
ahead of feet – this can reduce the urge to stretch the leg out in front.
Increase Cadence (Step Rate):  Overstriders usually have a  slower cadence  (maybe heal130–
160 steps per minute) paired with longer strides . By upping the step frequency, each stride
becomes naturally shorter (landing more under the body). In fact, increasing cadence is one of
the  quickest fixes  for overstriding . A commonly cited benchmark is ~180 spm for many
runners, but the exact number can vary. The idea is to gradually raise your cadence by ~5–10%.
Doing so shortens ground contact time and shifts foot strike closer to the center of gravity
. A practical method is using a metronome or cadence app : determine your current easy-
run cadence, then set a metronome to say +5% higher and practice running to that rhythm
. For example, if you naturally run at 160 spm, try 168 spm. This neuromuscular training
forces your legs to turn over quicker , leaving less time for them to fling out front. Over time, a
new cadence can feel natural, and the overstriding disappears. It’s recommended to implement
cadence increases gradually (perhaps in segments of runs or short drills) to let your body adapt.
A-Skip Drill:  As detailed earlier , the A-skip drill is excellent for overstriders because it trains
exactly the opposite pattern: you drive the foot down under the body . Coaches often specifically
prescribe A-skips to runners trying to fix overstriding . The emphasis on high knee and
then active foot strike underneath replicates the proper stride timing. When performing A-skips,
think  about  that  downward  “piston-like”  foot  drive  –  this  is  the  movement  you  want  to
integrate into your normal running. By drilling it, you build the muscle memory. According to
Sanford Health S&C specialists, “by driving the foot down to the ground (in A-skip), contact occurs
under  the  center  of  gravity  and  the  posterior  chain  muscles  are  activated  for  a  more  powerful
stride.”  In other words, it not only fixes overstriding but also makes your stride stronger .
“Run in Place” Lean Drill:  A quick exercise: jog in place with high knees. Then  lean forward
slightly from the ankles  – you will automatically start running forward. This teaches that if you
keep the cadence up (from the in-place jog) and simply lean, your stride length adjusts naturally
without reaching out. This drill, often mentioned in coaching circles, reinforces landing under the
body.
Uphill Running:  It is virtually impossible to overstride uphill because of the hill angle. Doing
short hill repeats is a sneaky way to teach proper foot strike. The ground meets you sooner due
to the incline, and you must lift knees and place feet directly under or even behind your center of61

mass to push up the hill . Integrating uphill sprints or runs can help overstriders learn not to
heel strike out front. It’s recommended to use moderate inclines (4–5% grade) and focus on
driving the knees and quick steps.
Barefoot Strides:  Running barefoot (or in minimal shoes) on a safe surface for short strides (50–
100m)  can  naturally  discourage  overstriding.  Most  people,  without  cushioned  shoes,  will
intuitively land more midfoot and under their body (landing heel-first far in front hurts when
barefoot) . A few strides barefoot at the end of runs can reinforce a midfoot strike and proper
foot  placement.  They  also  strengthen  the  feet.  Coaches  often  advise  3–5  ×  100m  relaxed
barefoot strides on grass as a form cue and foot strengthener for those trying to fix overstriding
.
Cadence and Cost:  One concern runners have is whether increasing cadence will make them expend
more energy (since you’re taking more steps). If done correctly (small increase, adjusting stride), the
metabolic cost increase is minimal, and sometimes running economy even improves . Research
and coaching observations have shown that a 5–10% increase in cadence  can reduce impact forces on
the  knees  by  ~15–20%  and  also  potentially  improve  running  efficiency .  In  many  cases,  an
overstrider’s “natural” cadence is not actually the most economical; they might be over-striding and
wasting energy braking. By upping cadence modestly, they eliminate the braking and utilize more
elastic bounce, which can offset the energy of a few extra steps . Of course, there is an optimal range
for each person, but the fear that moving from (say) 160 to 170 spm will sap your endurance is largely
unfounded if done gradually. In fact, many runners report feeling smoother and lighter at a higher
cadence once adapted . It’s about finding the sweet spot for you – very tall runners may not hit 180,
but  getting  out  of  an  excessively  slow  turnover  can  help  almost  everyone.  And  notably,  cadence
retraining doesn’t require huge mileage : even short, focused sessions with a metronome (like 5 minutes of
practice a few times a week) can be enough to shift your gait over time .
Metronome Training and Neuromuscular Patterning for Cadence
Metronome Training:  Using a metronome (or metronome audio app/music) is a direct way to train
your neuromuscular system to a new cadence. As mentioned, determine your current cadence, then set
a metronome a bit higher (e.g., +5%). Practice running to the beat  – start by matching your arm swing
or marching in place to it, then jog and eventually run at your desired pace while keeping in sync with
the ticks . Initially, it might feel awkward or “choppy,” but your body will adapt. The metronome gives
immediate feedback if you’re falling back into old habits (you’ll hear that you’re off the beat). This kind of
practice ingrains a new motor pattern. Over time, you internalize the quicker rhythm and can dispense
with the metronome. It essentially serves as training wheels for your cadence .
One method is to incorporate metronome sessions a couple times a week during easy runs or as a
warm-up drill. For example, run 1 mile listening to a cadence-beat track (or a song remixed to, say, 175
bpm). Focus on light, quick steps – it’s okay if your stride feels shorter . Ensure you’re not just shuffling –
still push off, but with a quicker turnover . Over weeks, your “natural” cadence might rise to match that
without needing the audio cue.
Neuromuscular Patterning:  The goal of cadence drills and form drills is to create muscle memory for
efficient movement . Drills like “Sweeps and Swings”  (sometimes used by coaches) involve practicing
the swinging forward of the leg and the backward sweep (paw-back) in a exaggerated but controlled
manner , often while standing in place . This builds the pattern of how a proper stride should feel
– with the foot landing near the body then extending behind. A-skips and B-skips, as detailed, also build
those neuromuscular pathways. Each repetition done correctly helps carve a pathway in the brain so
that, when running at full speed or under fatigue, the body reverts to that trained pattern . With70

enough repetition, the strides that once required conscious effort (higher cadence, foot under hip)
become automatic.
No Extra Metabolic Cost, Up to a Point:  Studies have shown that if you force a runner far outside their
preferred cadence, economy can worsen initially . However , if the change is subtle and addresses an
existing inefficiency, the runner can improve economy. In practical terms, a runner might find that
increasing cadence by ~5-7% makes them feel smoother and less bouncy , with no noticeable increase
in heart rate for the same pace – a sign that their efficiency is intact or improved. The body likely finds a
new equilibrium in which the energy saved from reduced braking and vertical oscillation compensates
for the slightly higher step frequency.
In summary,  cadence work via metronome drills and targeted form exercises  can help a runner
learn to run faster without  simply muscling it or increasing effort. Instead, they run faster (or with the
same speed less stress) by improving mechanics – which is the essence of neuromuscular training.
Implementation & Dosage of Drills
Having a library of drills and techniques is only part of the equation. Equally important is  how to
integrate these drills into a training program . When and how often should you do them? How many
reps or for what distance? How do you ensure the drills are actually improving form and not just done
for their own sake? And how should drill emphasis change through a season (periodization)? In this
section,  we’ll  cover  best  practices  for  implementing  running  drills  in  a  training  routine,  including
optimal  timing  (e.g.  as  warm-up  activation  or  separate  sessions),  appropriate  volume,  and
maintaining technical quality , as well as considerations for different phases of training.
Optimal Timing: Warm-Up Activation vs. Separate Sessions
During Warm-Ups (Activation):  A very common and effective approach is to include form drills as part
of the warm-up before the main workout . After an easy jog and dynamic stretches, drills like A-skips,
B-skips,  high  knees,  butt  kicks,  carioca,  etc.,  can  be  performed  to  “activate”  the  neuromuscular
system . This primes the specific muscles and rehearses the movements you want to reinforce in the
workout to follow. For example, before an interval track session or a sprint workout, doing A-skips and
straight-leg bounds can remind the athlete of proper mechanics (high knees, quick contacts) right
before they run fast. Many coaches consider drills indispensable in warm-ups for speed work .
Drills  elevate  heart  rate  slightly,  improve  range  of  motion,  and  wake  up  coordination,  effectively
bridging the gap between slow running and fast running. As coach Graham Eaton notes,  “A-runs (a
variation of A-skip) are a good sprint drill in a warm-up before acceleration & max velocity work”  – they
cue the athlete to strike down and cycle their legs, which is exactly what they need to do in the workout.
Integrated into Workouts:  Drills can also be inserted  within or at the end of workouts  in some
cases. For instance, a coach might have a sprinter do a 150m fast rep and then immediately go into 30m
of A-skips or A-runs afterward as a “finisher” to practice maintaining form under fatigue . This
method  helps  the  athlete  hold  technique  when  tired  (such  as  the  end  of  a  race).  Middle-distance
runners or even 5k/10k runners might do strides (short accelerations) after an easy run to reinforce
good  mechanics;  similarly,  they  could  do  a  few  form  drills  post-run  to  reset  and  ensure  they’re
ingraining efficient patterns.
Separate Drill Sessions:  For beginners or athletes focusing on form rehabilitation, separate technique
sessions  might be useful. This could look like a 20-minute session 1-2 times per week dedicated solely
to drills and strides, not connected to a strenuous run. In these sessions, the athlete is fresh and can79

concentrate fully on form without the fatigue of a prior workout. Such sessions are common in base
training phases or injury rehab – for example, a runner coming back from injury might do a drills
session to rebuild coordination before resuming harder training. Distance coaches sometimes have
their athletes do “drill circuits” on easy days for neuromuscular stimulus without overall stress.
Cool-Down / Auxiliary Use:  Some drills can be employed in cooldowns or general strength sessions
(for example, carioca or skipping drills as part of a circuit) for additional coordination work. However ,
performing drills in a state of extreme fatigue (like at the very end of a hard workout) can engrain poor
form if the athlete cannot execute well. It’s generally better to do drills when relatively fresh or only
moderately tired, so the quality remains high.
In-season vs Off-season:  In the off-season or general preparatory phase, some athletes might do drill-
focused practices  – for instance, a coach might dedicate one day a week to pure technical work:
running  drills,  plyos,  short  hill  sprints  (to  reinforce  form)  and  no  hard  aerobic  work  that  day.  In
competition season when workouts are more intense, the role of drills often shifts to a quick tune-up in
warm-ups  to  reinforce  already  learned  skills,  rather  than  learning  new  patterns.  But  they  remain
important; as one article noted, drills are “one part of designing a complete program” along with actual
running  and  strength  training  –  they  complement  but  don’t  replace  running.  Even  in-season,
continuing a bit of drills helps maintain the efficiency you built earlier .
Key Point:  Whenever you do them, drills need to have a context and purpose  (e.g., doing XYZ drill to
focus on knee lift before this sprint workout, or to improve foot strike in general) rather than doing
them mindlessly. As Coach Eaton says, “the only good drills are the drills done the right way in the
context they were intended” .
Volume and Technical Quality
Quality is paramount in drill execution. These exercises lose their value if done to the point of sloppy
form. Here are guidelines on volume and maintaining quality:
Keep Reps Short and Purposeful:  Drills are typically done for short distances or rep counts .
For example, an A-skip might be done for 20–30 meters at a time ; a carioca might be 20m
right, 20m back; straight-leg bounds might be 30m, etc. A common practice is 2–4 reps of a given
drill over that distance. Chris Johnson, a physical therapist and running coach, suggests initially
3–5 passes of ~10–15 yards  for each drill, especially for complex skips, to practice without
exhaustion . This ensures you get enough repetition to learn the skill but not so much that
fatigue sets in.
Stop at the First Sign of Form Breakdown:  The moment you notice your form is deteriorating –
for instance, you can’t hold dorsiflexion, or your posture hunches, or you’re not getting the
desired range –  stop the drill . Pushing through for extra meters or reps with bad form is
counterproductive; you’re then ingraining the wrong pattern. Many coaches explicitly say they
will stop athletes if their form breaks down  during drills . One or two high-quality reps beat
five sloppy ones. Drills are about neuromuscular learning, so you want only good inputs to the
system.
Use Recovery Between Reps:  Drills aren’t conditioning (mostly). You don’t do A-skips to get
“tired” – you do them to improve mechanics. So,  walk back to the start between drill reps ,
catch your breath, reset, and then do the next rep with full focus. Especially for plyometric-type84

---PAGE---

drills (hops, bounds), allow adequate recovery (30 seconds, a minute, or whatever needed) to
keep each contact explosive.
Combine with Strides:  A helpful approach is to do a drill and then go straight into a short stride
(accelerations). For instance, do 30m of A-skip, then transition into a 20m quick sprint. This helps
transfer the drill movement into actual running. It also naturally limits the drill’s length (you
switch to running once you feel form is dialed in). 
Monitor Ground Contact Times or Other Metrics:  If you have access to tools (like a contact
mat, or even just a coach’s eye), monitor the quality. As an example, in plyometric sessions aimed
at short GCT, if you see the contact time creeping up rep by rep, that’s a sign fatigue is affecting
quality – time to stop . Or if a drill was meant to be quick and coordinated (like fast feet), and
the athlete’s rhythm falters, end it. Some coaches make a game of it – e.g., perform pogo jumps
until you “feel” one rep that isn’t as snappy , then end the set there. This develops the athlete’s
self-awareness of technical degradation.
Progress Intensity Over Time:  Early on, perform drills at comfortable speeds to nail technique.
As proficiency increases, you can execute them at a more explosive or faster cadence to more
closely mimic high-speed running. For example, Mach’s protocol  was to eventually do skips “as
fast as possible” once form was correct . This progression should happen over weeks. During
the learning phase, rhythm and coordination trump speed. Later , add a little more “pop” to them.
Always revert to slower execution if form suffers at higher speeds.
Volume Within a Session:  You might select 4–6 drills in a session, 2–4 reps each, which typically
is sufficient. That could mean, say, 4 drills × 2 reps of 30m = 240m worth of drilling, which is
plenty  when  done  with  intent.  Doing  much  more  might  indicate  the  intensity  is  low  (like
extensive drills for warm-up, which is okay) or that you’re turning it into an endurance exercise,
which it is not. One exception is using very low-level skips or hops in a circuit for coordination
endurance, but even then, it’s broken into sets.
Listen to the Athlete:  If an athlete is feeling particularly fatigued from prior training on a given
day, reduce drill volume or skip exhaustive plyos. Drills demand freshness in the nervous system
to be effective. They shouldn’t feel like a heavy slog. The athlete should come away feeling
sharper , not depleted.
Periodization and Long-Term Integration
General Preparation Phase (Off-Season/Base):  In the early phase of training, when the focus is often
on building an aerobic base and general strength, drills can be introduced and practiced in higher
frequency. The goal here is  skill acquisition and general athletic development . Volumes can be
slightly higher (more reps) since intensities are moderate. Coaches might incorporate a  “drills and
strides day”  each week. Also, more  strength-oriented drills  like bounding, skipping, and extensive
plyometrics are common in base training to develop power that will be tapped into later . For
instance, a college sprint coach might use straight-leg bounds and various jumps throughout the fall
GPP to build robustness and explosive qualities even while the main workouts are not yet highly intense
. Distance coaches may have their athletes do Mach drills twice a week year-round (as seen in
the “Lauf ABC” approach for distance runners) – they advise ~10 minutes of drills 2x weekly as a way to
“optimize muscular control and clean movements” , treating it as an investment in form efficiency

During this period,  learning new drills  and perfecting technique is emphasized. It’s a good time to
teach a formerly overstriding runner the A-skip, for example, when there’s time to adapt before key
races. Variation can also be introduced (different arm positions or added resistance in drills) to keep
athletes engaged and work on weak links .
Specific Preparation Phase (Pre-Competition):  As training shifts to more event-specific work (speed,
race-pace runs, etc.), the drilling might become a bit more event-tailored. Sprinters might introduce
more frequent  high-speed drills  (like wicket runs or buildups that emphasize turnover), and reduce
time  spent  on,  say,  heavy  bounding.  Middle-distance  runners  may  still  do  drills  but  perhaps  less
bounding and more skipping/strides to avoid excessive muscle fatigue that could interfere with key
workouts. The total volume of drill work might be scaled back slightly, as the intensity of other training
is higher . But  consistency is key  – the drills that were mastered in the off-season should still be
touched on to keep the patterns sharp. This is where athletes often take those drills and incorporate
them fluidly into their warm-ups.
Competition Phase:  In peak season, maintenance and fine-tuning  is the theme. Drills are generally
high-quality, low-volume, used to activate muscles and reinforce form before races or hard sessions. For
example, on race day a sprinter will do a series of skips, buildups, etc., to get ready – those drills are
short and crisp. You likely won’t be doing exhaustive hops or depth jumps within a few days of a race
because the risk/reward tilts (they can cause soreness or neuromuscular fatigue). Instead, you might do
light pogos or a few flying start strides to remind the body of quick contacts and then trust your
training. 
Addressing Weaknesses Through Periodization:  If an analysis of an athlete’s form or performance
shows a particular deficit (say, poor top-end cadence, or weak pushoff), you can periodize an emphasis
on certain drills. For instance, if an athlete has great endurance but poor elasticity, the coach might
schedule a 6-week block in early pre-season focusing on plyometric drills (pogos, hurdle hops, etc.) to
boost  leg  stiffness,  then  taper  that  as  the  racing  season  approaches.  Or  an  athlete  with  form
breakdown at the end of races might be given a protocol of form drills under fatigue (like the earlier
example of 150m + A-run) during the specific phase to prepare for that scenario .
Long-Term Adaptation:  Over months and years, the goal is that these drills permanently elevate the
athlete’s movement efficiency. Studies have indicated that performing drills regularly leads to more
efficient neuromuscular patterns  in the long run . Essentially, the drills help “lock in” the motor
pathways for optimal running form. As the athlete progresses, drills can become more advanced (for
example, single-leg variations, adding mini-hurdles, etc.) to continue providing a coordination challenge
and stimulus.
Periodicity and Recovery:  One should also consider not overdoing drills to the point they impede
recovery. Some drills, especially plyometrics, are quite intense on the muscles and tendons. They should
be treated with respect in the program – much like heavy lifting. If you did a hard plyo session, you
might not schedule another on back-to-back days. During taper or recovery weeks, drill volume might
be reduced, focusing only on a few that are crucial for neuromuscular sharpness.
Summary:  Running drills are a tool that, when used at the right time and dose, can yield significant
improvements  in  technique  and  performance.  Implement  them  thoughtfully:  use  them  consistently
(especially in early training), keep quality high , and tailor their use as the season progresses . By doing so,
you develop athletes who not only run faster but do so with sound mechanics and lower injury risk.
When done right, “when they do the drills right, your athletes have a fighting chance”  of reaching
their performance potential . Each drill is a small investment in better form that, compounded over
time, pays off in the form of smoother , faster , and safer running. 93
