Running Biomechanics: Spring-Mass Model and
Leg Stiffness
Introduction
Running  is  a  complex  biomechanical  process  often  modeled  in  terms  of  springs  and  masses.
Understanding how our legs function like springs, and how stiffness in our tendons and muscles affects
running, can provide valuable insights for both improving performance and reducing injury risk. This
document provides a deep dive into  running biomechanics , focusing on the  spring-mass model  of
running and the related concept of leg stiffness . Key topics include: how elastic energy is stored and
released in the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia, definitions of  vertical stiffness (K_vert)  and  leg
stiffness (K_leg)  and their relationship to running economy, the impact of running cadence and vertical
oscillation on impact forces, and how plyometric training  can increase tendon stiffness without adding
muscle mass. The content is presented in a practical, coaching-oriented manner , aimed at a broad
range of runners – from amateurs (including those prone to injuries) to semi-professionals – to help
translate biomechanics research into actionable training insights.
Short, focused sections and bullet points are used for clarity, making it easy to scan and find key points.
By the end of this document, coaches and runners should have a solid understanding of spring-like
mechanics in running and how to apply these principles to improve running efficiency and safety.
The Spring-Mass Model of Running
In  running  biomechanics,  a  simple  yet  powerful  representation  is  the  spring-mass  model .  In  this
model, the runner's body is depicted as a point mass (located at the center of mass, roughly near the
torso) attached to a massless spring that represents the leg . Each running step is analogous to
compressing and rebounding a spring. When the foot contacts the ground during the stance phase, the
leg “spring” compresses (bending at the ankle, knee, and hip) under the body weight, storing elastic
energy. In the latter part of stance, the spring recoils, releasing energy to propel the body upward and
forward into the next step. This spring-like behavior can be observed in the vertical motion of a runner’s
center of mass and the force applied to the ground, which together follow a characteristic pattern
resembling a bouncing spring . The spring-mass model helps explain why running has a natural
bounce and how mechanical energy is conserved and returned from step to step with relatively high
efficiency.
Key characteristics of the spring-mass model:
-  Compression  and  Rebound:  During  foot  contact,  the  leg  acts  like  a  compressing  spring.  The
maximum compression occurs at mid-stance, after which the spring recoils to push the runner off the
ground .
-  Energy Storage:  As the leg compresses, elastic structures (tendons and connective tissues) store
potential  energy.  This  stored  energy  is  then  released  as  kinetic  energy  during  push-off,  aiding  in
forward propulsion.
- Oscillation of COM:  The runner’s center of mass (COM) undergoes a slight up-and-down oscillation
each stride. It descends during the loading phase and rises during the propulsion phase, much like a
mass bouncing on a spring. The amplitude of this COM oscillation is linked to the system’s stiffness – a1

stiffer leg spring results in less vertical displacement for a given force.
-  Resonant  Frequency:  Every  spring-mass  system  has  a  natural  (resonant)  frequency  at  which  it
oscillates most efficiently. In running, there may be an optimal cadence or stiffness at which the effort
(energy cost) is minimized for a given speed . Deviating from this optimum (e.g. running with a
stride frequency much higher or lower than the natural frequency of the runner’s “spring”) can increase
energy cost .
By modeling running with this simple spring-mass analogy, researchers and coaches can quantify how
“bouncy” or stiff a runner’s gait is, and how changes in mechanics (like bending the knees more or less)
will affect forces and energy use. It establishes a foundation for discussing  leg stiffness  and how it
influences running performance and economy, which we will explore in later sections.
Elastic Energy Storage in the Achilles Tendon and Plantar Fascia
A remarkable feature of human running is the body’s ability to  store and return elastic energy  in
tendons and other connective tissues. Two key structures in this elastic energy recycling system are the
Achilles tendon  and the plantar fascia  (along with the foot’s arch). These act like springs that stretch
under load and spring back, contributing to the efficiency of running.
Achilles Tendon: Nature’s Rubber Band
The Achilles tendon (highlighted above) connects the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) to the heel bone
(calcaneus). It is one of the strongest and thickest tendons in the body, acting like a powerful spring to store
and release energy during running.
The Achilles tendon plays a pivotal role in running mechanics. When you land on your foot during
running, your ankle flexes (dorsiflexes) under the load, which stretches the Achilles tendon. This action
stores elastic strain energy  in the tendon, much like stretching a rubber band. As you push off into the
next stride (plantarflexing the ankle), the Achilles tendon recoils, releasing that stored energy to help
propel you forward and upward . This cycle of energy storage and return reduces the amount of
work the muscles in the calf must do, thereby improving efficiency.
Research  has  quantified  just  how  much  energy  the  Achilles  tendon  can  handle.  Classic  studies
estimated that the Achilles tendon can store on the order of 35 Joules  of energy with each step when
running at moderate speeds (~4.5 m/s, roughly a 6-minute mile pace) . More recent analyses using
advanced models and imaging techniques have shown that at faster speeds, the contribution of tendon
elasticity becomes even more pronounced. For example, as running speed increases from a jog (~2 m/s)
to a sprint (≥8 m/s), the percentage of positive work done by the ankle’s muscle-tendon unit that comes
from tendon elastic recoil (as opposed to direct muscle work) rises significantly – one study found it
increased from about 53% to 74%  for the soleus muscle’s tendon and similarly from 62% to 75%  for the
gastrocnemius’ tendon . In essence, at top speeds, three-quarters or more of the ankle’s output
can be attributed to elastic energy return from the stretched Achilles tendon, with the muscles acting in
a more isometric manner to facilitate this spring action.
To put it another way, thanks to the long Achilles tendon, the plantar-flexor muscles (calf muscles) can
let the tendon do a large portion of the work. Up to around 60% of the mechanical work  done by the
muscle-tendon unit during running can be temporarily stored as elastic energy in the Achilles tendon
and then released . This greatly reduces the metabolic cost: the muscles don’t have to shorten as
much or as quickly, which saves energy. The tendon’s elasticity effectively “recycles” energy that would
otherwise be lost as heat. This is a crucial mechanism behind running efficiency – it’s one reason3

humans  (and  many  animals)  can  run  for  extended  periods  without  exhausting  their  muscles
immediately; the tendons provide free energy return.
It’s worth noting that the Achilles tendon doesn’t act alone – the whole triceps surae  muscle-tendon
unit (gastrocnemius and soleus muscles with the Achilles tendon) is structured to optimize this effect.
The muscles have relatively short fibers and attach to the heel via the long tendon, a design that allows
significant tendon stretch while muscle fibers change length only minimally . During running,
the calf muscle fibers can behave quasi-isometrically (staying nearly the same length) while the Achilles
tendon stretches and recoils. This means the muscles can operate at their optimal length and velocity
for force production, further improving efficiency, as a near-isometric muscle contraction is far more
economical than a fast shortening contraction . Studies have shown that when the soleus muscle
operates  in  this  optimized  way  (high  force,  low  shortening),  runners  have  better  economy  (lower
oxygen consumption for the same speed) .
In summary, the Achilles tendon:  - Stores significant elastic energy with each foot strike and releases
it at push-off, contributing free propulsion. - Can account for a majority of the work done at the ankle
joint (especially at higher speeds), reducing the required muscle work . - Enables muscles to
function  more  economically  by  allowing  them  to  act  isometrically  (or  nearly  so)  while  the  tendon
handles length change, thereby saving metabolic energy . - Helps explain why improving Achilles
tendon properties (like stiffness, which we discuss later) or technique to better utilize the tendon’s
spring could improve running economy.
From  a  coaching  perspective,  this  highlights  the  importance  of  a  healthy,  strong  Achilles  tendon.
Runners often do exercises like eccentric heel drops or plyometrics (which we’ll cover) to strengthen the
Achilles and improve its stiffness and energy-return capability. However , one must also be cautious – the
Achilles endures very high forces (on the order of  6-12 times body weight  during running ), and
sudden changes in training or poor biomechanics can overload it, potentially leading to injury. Gradual
training that enhances the tendon’s capacity can both improve performance and reduce injury risk.
Plantar Fascia and the Foot’s Arch: The Spring in Your Step
The plantar fascia (highlighted above) spans the underside of the foot, supporting the arch. It behaves like a
spring by stretching and shortening during each stride, storing elastic energy when the arch flattens and
releasing it as the arch recoils.
While the Achilles tendon is the star of elastic energy storage in the lower leg, the plantar fascia  and
the associated arch of the foot play an essential supporting role. The plantar fascia is a thick band of
connective tissue running along the bottom of the foot from the heel to the forefoot. Together with the
ligaments and muscles of the foot, it forms the longitudinal arch , which is not rigid – it behaves like a
spring that flattens and recoils during gait.
During the foot strike and mid-stance of running, the arch of the foot temporarily flattens  under load,
which stretches the plantar fascia (and related ligaments). This is often described by the  windlass
mechanism : as the toes dorsiflex (bend upward) and weight is applied, the plantar fascia winds around
the metatarsophalangeal joints (the ball of the foot), increasing tension. This process stores elastic
strain energy in the stretched arch (similar to stretching a spring) . Later in stance, as the heel
lifts and the runner moves to push off, the tension in the plantar fascia helps to shorten and raise the
arch  (the  windlass  mechanism  reels  the  arch  back  up),  releasing  the  stored  energy  to  aid  in  the
propulsion of the body forward . Essentially, the foot’s arch and plantar fascia act like a  bow and
arrow : the arch flattens (bowstring stretches) then springs back, adding a springy push to the stride.1011

The contribution of the arch’s spring to running efficiency is significant. Researchers Ker et al. famously
concluded that “the arch of the foot stores enough strain energy to make running more energy efficient.”  In
quantitative terms, studies have found that the energy stored and returned by the deformation of the
foot arch is non-trivial. For example, one study indicated that the foot’s arch can store and return on
the order of 17% of the energy  needed for each step (this is a figure sometimes cited from classical
studies, although exact percentages vary by speed and individual). More recent works, such as Welte et
al. (2021), reaffirm that the arch behaves like a spring:  “the plantar fascia stretches and then shortens
throughout gait as the arch-spring stores and releases elastic energy.” . In running, this means some of
the impact energy when your foot hits the ground is absorbed by the flattening of your arch and then
given back to help push you off the ground.
The combined effect  of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia working in series (one behind the ankle,
one within the foot) is often likened to a two-spring system: one large spring from calf to heel, and
another from heel to toes. The coordination of these springs is crucial. If the arch is too floppy or the
plantar fascia too lax, energy is lost (the arch might collapse excessively, dissipating energy as heat or
strain on tissues rather than storing it). If the arch is too rigid, it might not store enough energy or
could  transfer  stress  upward,  potentially  leading  to  injuries.  A  well-tuned  arch  will  compress  just
enough to store energy and then recoil efficiently at toe-off .
Why it matters for coaches and runners:  A strong and well-functioning plantar fascia contributes to
running  economy  and  helps  prevent  injuries  like  plantar  fasciitis  or  stress  fractures  in  the  foot.
Strengthening the intrinsic foot muscles (which support the arch) and maintaining the health of the
plantar fascia can improve this natural shock absorption and recoil. Drills like short foot exercises (to
strengthen  the  arch)  or  simply  running  barefoot  on  a  soft  surface  occasionally  (which  naturally
strengthens the arch) have been suggested by some coaches to enhance the foot’s spring mechanism
(with caution to avoid overdoing it). It’s also observed that running form can influence arch dynamics: a
runner who overstrides with a heavy heel strike might load the arch in a less-than-ideal way, whereas a
midfoot strike can allow a smoother engagement of the arch spring – though foot strike patterns vary
by individual and there is no one-size-fits-all technique.
In summary, the plantar fascia and foot arch act as the  lower spring  of the leg, complementing the
Achilles tendon:
- They store elastic energy  when the foot is loaded (arch flattens) and return energy  during push-off
(arch recoils), contributing to forward propulsion .
-  They  dynamically  adjust  foot  stiffness:  a  compliant  arch  at  landing  helps  absorb  shock,  then  a
stiffening arch at push-off provides a lever for efficient force transfer .
- A well-conditioned arch can  improve running economy  by saving energy (the more work done by
passive structures like tendons, the less the muscles have to do). Indeed, enhancing arch stiffness has
been linked with better energy efficiency in running .
- Proper training and possibly footwear choice (shoes that don’t overly immobilize the arch) can help
maintain the foot’s natural spring function.
Both the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia illustrate the principle that stiffness and elasticity in the
right measure can improve performance . This sets the stage for understanding leg stiffness  more
broadly – which is essentially how these springs (and others in the leg) combine to affect the mechanics
of running.16

Defining Vertical Stiffness (K_vert) and Leg Stiffness (K_leg)
When we talk about a runner being “stiff” or “springy,” we often refer to measurable quantities known
as  vertical  stiffness  and  leg  stiffness .  These  terms  come  from  the  spring-mass  model  and  help
quantify how the runner’s leg-spring behaves during the contact phase of running. While they are
related concepts, they have specific definitions:
Leg Stiffness (K_leg):  In running biomechanics, leg stiffness is defined as the ratio of the peak
vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) to the maximum leg spring compression  that occurs during
the stance phase . Here, “leg spring compression” (ΔL) is the change in length of the leg
(often measured from hip to ankle or hip to foot) from the moment of touchdown to the point of
maximum knee/ankle bend at mid-stance. Essentially, it tells how much force is generated per
unit  displacement  of  the  leg  spring.  A  higher  K_leg  means  that  for  a  given  force,  the  leg
compresses less – in other words, the leg behaves more stiffly (it’s harder to bend). 
Vertical Stiffness (K_vert):  Vertical stiffness is defined as the ratio of the peak vertical ground
reaction force to the maximum vertical displacement of the center of mass (COM)  during stance .
The  vertical  displacement  of  the  COM  (Δy)  is  how  far  the  runner’s  center  of  mass  moves
downwards from initial contact to mid-stance. K_vert thus indicates how “bouncy” the runner is
in the vertical direction. A high K_vert means the runner’s COM doesn’t drop very much under
load (for a given force), i.e. the runner is bouncing less and is more rigid vertically.
To visualize the difference: imagine a running step. When the foot hits the ground, your body’s center of
mass starts to lower and your leg joints bend. Leg stiffness (K_leg)  is concerned with how much the leg
length  changes (hip-to-foot distance shortens as knee/ankle bend) under the force, whereas  vertical
stiffness (K_vert)  focuses on how much the body’s height  (COM height) changes under that force. The
leg can compress not only by vertical motion but also by geometry (the leg angle). If you land more
upright  versus  more  squat,  the  leg  compression  vs  COM  drop  might  differ .  In  a  perfectly  vertical
landing, leg compression and COM drop are similar; but if the leg is at an angle, some leg compression
doesn’t translate purely to vertical drop of COM.
Mathematically, these stiffness values are often calculated using a simple harmonic motion analogy
where the ground reaction force approximates a sine-wave during contact. For example, one method
uses: 
where   is the peak vertical ground reaction force (often normalized to body weight),   is the
downward displacement of COM, and   is the compression of the leg spring . Researchers like
McMahon & Cheng (1990) popularized these calculations for running.
It’s important to note units: Stiffness is measured in kN/m (kilonewtons per meter) if using absolute
units. Many times, for comparison between runners of different weights, the force might be normalized
to body weight and stiffness reported in e.g. “body weights per meter”. Regardless, higher numbers
mean a stiffer system.•

Relationship between K_vert and K_leg:  Though related, K_vert and K_leg are not identical and can
differ based on running mechanics: - K_vert is influenced by how much you allow your body to bounce.
Even if the leg compresses, if your posture or running mechanics allow your hips to drop a certain
amount, that affects K_vert. - K_leg is influenced by the composite stiffness of all joints (ankle, knee, hip)
acting together along the leg’s length. In practice, these values often correlate, but one can change
without the other . For instance, running with a more bent-knee style might increase leg compression
(affecting K_leg) but also lower the body more (affecting K_vert). 
Typical values and factors:  As an example, a moderately trained runner might have a leg stiffness on
the order of 8–12 kN/m and a vertical stiffness in somewhat a similar range normalized to body weight
(exact values depend on measurement specifics). Several factors affect stiffness: -  Speed:  As running
speed increases, studies have found that  vertical stiffness (K_vert) tends to increase  (you become
“stiffer” vertically at higher speeds), while leg stiffness (K_leg) often remains relatively constant  or
changes less dramatically . The reasoning is that at higher speeds, ground contact time is shorter
and you naturally adopt a bouncier , stiffer stride to accommodate the greater forces, thus COM doesn’t
drop as much (high K_vert). But the absolute leg compression might not change drastically, so K_leg
stays in a narrow range. - Footwear and Surface:  A softer surface or heavily cushioned shoe can allow
more COM displacement (lower K_vert) as the surface itself deforms, and runners often subconsciously
adjust leg stiffness when going from soft to hard surfaces (stiffer leg on soft ground to maintain
bounce). This is known as stiffness regulation. - Fatigue:  As a runner fatigues, leg and vertical stiffness
can change – sometimes stiffness decreases with extreme fatigue (leading to more collapse in each
step), although trained runners may maintain stiffness to preserve economy. - Foot strike and form:  A
forefoot  striker  might  exhibit  different  stiffness  characteristics  than  a  heel  striker .  For  example,  a
habitual forefoot striker may have a stiffer ankle but more knee flex (or vice versa) depending on their
style, affecting effective stiffness. - Anatomy and Strength:  Stronger tendons and muscles can handle
and impart greater forces for less deformation, thus increasing stiffness. Someone with very compliant
joints or weaker connective tissue might exhibit lower stiffness (more give).
To avoid confusion: Stiffness in this context is not “tightness” in a colloquial sense, but a mechanical
description of spring behavior . A highly trained runner with a light, springy step has  high stiffness  in
these definitions (they spring off the ground quickly with little bounce loss), whereas a runner who feels
“mushy” with each step (deep sink and slow rebound) has lower stiffness .
So why do we care about K_leg and K_vert? Because they relate to running economy and injury risk ,
as we discuss next. These metrics give us a way to quantify and correlate how changes in training or
biomechanics affect performance.
Leg Stiffness, Vertical Stiffness, and Running Economy
Running  Economy  (RE)  refers  to  how  efficiently  a  person  uses  energy  while  running  at  a  given
submaximal speed. It’s often measured by the oxygen consumption (VO₂) at a steady running pace –
lower  VO₂  for  the  same  speed  =  better  economy.  Many  factors  contribute  to  running  economy,
including biomechanics. Leg and vertical stiffness are particularly interesting because they determine
how much energy is conserved versus lost each step.
Intuitively, if you are too “bouncy” (low stiffness), you waste energy bobbing up and down. If you are
extremely rigid (perhaps very high stiffness), you might minimize vertical motion but could generate
large impact forces or not store energy effectively. There seems to be an optimal range of stiffness for
economy, and indeed research has looked into correlations between stiffness and oxygen cost.21

---PAGE---

A seminal study by Dalleau et al. (1998) found a strong relationship between leg stiffness and running
energy cost . In that study, eight trained runners ran at 90% of their maximal aerobic velocity, and
their energy cost (Cr , in ml O₂/kg/m) was measured. The stiffness of their legs was computed via a
spring-mass  model.  The  result:  running  cost  was  significantly  negatively  correlated  with  leg
stiffness  (r  =  –0.80) .  In  simpler  terms,  runners  with  higher  leg  stiffness  had  better  running
economy (lower oxygen cost). Additionally, they found that when runners’ actual step frequency was
close to the resonant frequency of their leg-spring system (i.e., they ran “in tune” with their natural
spring rate), they were more economical . If there was a big mismatch between preferred step rate
and the leg’s natural frequency, energy cost went up . This suggests that both having an optimal
stiffness and cadence to match that stiffness improves efficiency.
Other studies have echoed and expanded on these findings: - Heise and Martin (1998) reported that
vertical  stiffness  (K_vert)  had  a  moderate  correlation  with  running  economy,  whereas  leg  stiffness
(K_leg) did not show a significant correlation in their data. This indicates that  how much you bounce
vertically  might be a better predictor of economy than leg compression in some cases. - Man et al.
(2016) found both K_vert and K_leg significantly correlated with RE in their sample, supporting the idea
that stiffer runners are more economical . - A 2022 study noted in Frontiers Physiology states that
K_vert  and  K_leg  are  generally  considered  contributors  to  improved  RE  because  they  can  reduce
energy cost in vertical movements and increase elastic energy storage  in the muscle-tendon units
. The rationale is that a stiffer system wastes less energy on unnecessary motion (like excessive up-
and-down movement) and can better harness elastic return .
However , findings aren’t completely uniform across all studies: For example, in the same Frontiers
article, the authors found in recreational runners that vertical stiffness (K_vert)  correlated moderately
with RE (r ≈ –0.45, p = 0.049), but leg stiffness (K_leg)  did not show a significant correlation .
Their primary finding was that K_vert (global stiffness of the bounce) was linked to better economy,
whereas  the  stiffness  at  individual  joints  or  the  overall  leg  compression  was  less  directly  tied  to
economy in that group . This might be due to individual variations in running form or the level of
the  runners  (perhaps  in  less  trained  runners,  technique  differences  make  vertical  motion  more
important).
Despite some mixed results, the overall consensus  leans toward the idea that some degree of stiffness is
beneficial for running economy : You want enough stiffness to capitalize on elastic energy return and to
avoid wasting energy, but not so much stiffness that you cause extreme impact forces or mechanical
inefficiencies. Essentially, a well-trained runner often naturally finds that sweet spot. If a runner is too
wobbly (too compliant), they might benefit from strength and plyometric training to increase stiffness
and improve economy . Conversely, if a runner is extremely stiff (which might show up as very
high impact peaks or perhaps higher injury risk), they might need to ensure they have adequate shock
absorption capacity (maybe through slight adjustments in form or footwear).
Why would higher stiffness improve economy?  Two main reasons: 1.  Reduced Vertical Motion =
Reduced Work:  Every time you bounce higher than necessary, you have to lift your body’s weight up,
which costs energy, and then absorb it on the way down. A stiffer runner limits that vertical oscillation,
meaning less energy expended lifting the body and less braking on landing . Essentially, more of the
energy is directed into forward motion instead of up-and-down. 2. Better Elastic Return:  A stiff leg acts
like a taut spring that can store and release energy quickly. More of the stride’s energy is stored in
tendons and returned, and less is lost as heat or muscle work. Dalleau et al. (1998) theorized this was
the reason stiffer legs were more economical – the elastic elements did more work, sparing metabolic
energy . And as discussed earlier , tendons operating in their optimal range can significantly cut
down the energy muscles need to expend for a given force .3

There is also an optimal cadence interaction: If a runner has a very compliant leg, they might naturally
adopt a slower cadence with longer contact times, which can hurt economy. Too stiff and they might
have an unnaturally high cadence or very short contact that isn’t metabolically optimal either . Coaches
sometimes speak of finding your optimal bounce . 
Practically, how can this knowledge be used?
-  Assessing  Stiffness:  Coaches  can  indirectly  gauge  if  an  athlete  is  too  compliant  or  too  stiff  by
observing running form and maybe measuring things like vertical oscillation (some running watches
give an estimate of vertical oscillation in centimeters). If a runner’s vertical oscillation is excessively high
(bounding run), they might be wasting energy. If it’s extremely low and they look like they are shuffling,
that could indicate either efficiency or possibly over-braking (depending on context). Ground contact
time  is  another  indirect  metric;  very  long  contact  times  often  correlate  with  lower  stiffness  (and
sometimes poorer economy), whereas very short contact times correlate with high stiffness and often
better  performance  up  to  a  point.  -  Training  Interventions:  If  a  runner  is  identified  as  relatively
compliant (low stiffness, high bounce, long contact), plyometric or strength training might help increase
their stiffness and improve economy. Indeed, Dalleau’s work implied that if you could safely increase leg
stiffness, you’d likely lower energy cost . We will discuss plyometrics later , which are commonly used
for this purpose. On the other hand, if a runner is extremely stiff and getting injured (like always
nursing shin splints or joint pain from high impacts), a coach might work on their form to introduce a
bit more compliance (e.g., encouraging a slight increase in knee flexion on landing, or softer footwear)
to protect them, though this might come with a small economy cost. -  Personal Optimization:  Each
individual may have a unique optimal stiffness. There is evidence that runners self-optimize stiffness to
some degree. For instance, if you give a runner a new pair of shoes or a different surface, after a few
steps they unconsciously adjust leg stiffness (a phenomenon observed where runners on a soft surface
will stiffen their leg to keep overall behavior consistent). It suggests that the body tries to maintain an
optimal COM oscillation for efficiency and comfort. 
In summary,  vertical stiffness and leg stiffness are key biomechanical factors tied to running
economy . Many studies support the view that a stiffer (but not too stiff) leg spring improves economy
by  minimizing  wasted  energy  and  maximizing  elastic  return .  A  practical  take-home  is  that
training aimed at improving the spring-like properties of the legs – stronger muscles and tendons,
plyometric ability – could make a runner more efficient. Indeed, elite runners often exhibit high stiffness
values: they appear to “float” with minimal vertical motion and quick, springy contacts. Recreational
runners can often improve economy by gently shifting toward those characteristics, within safe and
individualized limits.
Next, we’ll examine how specific changes in running form – namely  cadence (step frequency)  and
vertical oscillation  – impact the forces experienced during running. This ties closely into stiffness: for
example, increasing cadence usually affects stiffness and oscillation in ways that can reduce impact
stresses.
Impact of Cadence and Vertical Oscillation on Impact Forces
Running impact forces are those jarring loads that occur each time the foot hits the ground. These
forces – particularly the vertical ground reaction force and its loading rate – have been associated with
injury risk (e.g., higher impact peaks and loading rates have been linked to stress fractures, plantar
fasciitis, etc., in some studies). Two highly interrelated factors that influence impact forces are cadence
(how many steps per minute you take) and vertical oscillation  (how much your body moves up and
down each stride). 22

---PAGE---

Running Cadence:  This is typically measured in steps per minute (spm). A higher cadence means you
take more, shorter steps in a given time. A lower cadence means fewer , longer strides.
Vertical  Oscillation:  This  measures  the  vertical  movement  of  the  torso  (or  COM)  during  running,
usually reported in centimeters. For example, a runner might have a vertical oscillation of ~8 cm,
meaning their torso moves roughly 8 cm up and down with each step.
These two are inversely related in practice: If you increase your cadence (while maintaining the same
speed), each step is shorter , so you don’t have time (or need) to launch as high in the air , which generally
reduces vertical oscillation . Conversely, a low cadence with long strides often comes with a higher
bounce per step.
So how do they affect impact forces? -  Higher Cadence (lower oscillation) : Taking more steps per
minute (usually 5–10% more than a runner’s self-selected cadence) has been found to  reduce impact
forces and loading rates . Essentially, each step is less “hard” because the runner is landing with slightly
less speed per step (since speed = stride length × stride rate, if stride length is shorter , the foot has less
distance to fall and less braking to do at each contact). Research backs this up: A 5–10% increase in
cadence  can lead to noticeably lower peak vertical ground reaction forces and lower loading rates
at a given running speed . One systematic review in 2025 concluded that a moderate cadence
increase “ induces beneficial biomechanical changes, including reduced vertical ground reaction forces, lower
loading rates, shorter stride length, decreased vertical oscillation of the center of mass, and improved lower-
limb joint alignment, without compromising energy efficiency .” . That’s a powerful statement: by
simply  upping  the  cadence  a  bit,  a  runner  can  make  their  stride  softer  and  safer  and not  pay  a
metabolic penalty (in fact, some studies showed a slight improvement in running economy with higher
cadence, likely because of improved mechanics and reduced braking) .
Lower Cadence (higher oscillation) : If a runner has a low cadence, they are typically bounding
more with each step (higher vertical oscillation) and covering more ground per stride. This often
results in a harsher landing. The foot might land further ahead of the body (overstriding) which
increases braking forces, and the vertical drop of the COM is larger which leads to a larger
impact peak when that motion is arrested at foot contact. Therefore, lower cadence (or excessive
stride length) is associated with higher impact forces and loading rates . Clinically, many gait
retraining programs for injured runners involve increasing cadence precisely to counteract this.
For instance, someone with tibial stress fractures or knee pain might be coached to increase
cadence by ~7.5–10%, because it’s been shown to reduce the impact loading on the tibia and
knee significantly (some studies demonstrated ~20% reduction in knee joint forces with ~10%
cadence increase) .
Vertical Oscillation’s role:  Vertical oscillation is basically a direct measure of how much kinetic energy
goes into lifting the runner’s mass each step. The more you go up, the more you must come down – and
that “coming down” translates to impact. A high vertical oscillation means the runner is getting a lot of
airtime and then experiencing a big impact on landing (unless they are extraordinarily light on their
feet). A lower oscillation means a flatter trajectory with presumably lower collision forces. 
From a physics perspective, when you land from a greater height, the impact force is higher (assuming
the leg stiffness doesn’t change to compensate). So reducing vertical oscillation can directly reduce
impact magnitude. A practical example: if a runner bounces 10 cm versus 5 cm, the difference in drop
height can be felt as a harder thud. 
However , it’s worth noting there’s an interplay: a stiff runner can have low oscillation but might have
high instantaneous impact if not attenuated by joints. Typically though, studies confirm that decreasing3031

---PAGE---

vertical oscillation through technique (such as increasing cadence or changing foot strike softly)
leads to lower impact peaks and gentler loading . 
Evidence from literature:
A 2020 study by Adams et al. found that when runners increased their step rate by 5–10%, the peak
vGRF and shock at the tibia both decreased, and the braking impulse was reduced as well . Another
study reported that a +7.5% cadence increase resulted in ~15–20% reduction in energy absorbed at the
knee and hip joints, highlighting how cadence can shift loading patterns to be safer . The systematic
review  by  Figueiredo  et  al.  (2025)  summarized  across  many  studies  that  cadence  modifications
consistently show “reduced vertical ground reaction forces, lower loading rates, shorter stride length,”  and
importantly “did not negatively affect metabolic cost and, in some cases, enhanced running economy.”
. This means runners can often get a double benefit – run softer and not lose efficiency.
One concept here is “duty factor”  – the fraction of the gait cycle spent on the ground. A higher cadence
often  increases  duty  factor  (slightly  longer  relative  contact  time,  since  cycle  is  shorter)  which  can
distribute forces more evenly. Some researchers categorize running styles as “gazelle” (more flight,
lower duty factor) vs “elephant” (more ground contact, higher duty factor). Neither is inherently bad, but
extreme gazelle (very bouncy) means high impacts, while extreme elephant might mean very shuffling
gait (low impact but possibly less efficient at fast speeds). Ideally, there’s a balance, and a mid-high
cadence tends to find that.
Cadence and Leg Stiffness:  When you increase cadence, interestingly, vertical stiffness tends to go up
– because you are reducing vertical movement (Δy goes down), so for the same force, K_vert = F/Δy
increases. Indeed, one study on downhill running found that going to +10% cadence raised K_vert by
~16% . However , the peak force itself might slightly drop or stay similar (they found GRF changes
were  small,  but  loading  rate  changes  were  present).  The  net  effect  is  shorter ,  quicker ,  “snappier”
contacts (higher stiffness in spring terms, but lower absolute impact). This can be a bit confusing:
stiffness goes up, yet impact goes down? The resolution is that by changing the movement pattern, the
nature of force application changes – you might have a slightly higher average stiffness, but because
you’re not dropping as far , you never develop as high a collision speed/force at contact.
Practical advice on cadence and oscillation:
- Many coaches recommend that recreational runners experiment with a slight cadence increase if they
have high vertical oscillation or are injury-prone. A commonly cited benchmark is ~170–180 steps per
minute as an optimal range for distance running, though it varies by individual and speed (elite runners
often run at 180+ spm even at moderate paces). If someone is at, say, 160 spm at their easy pace with a
bounce of 10 cm, increasing to ~170 spm might smooth out their gait. - Changes should be made
gradually. Jumping directly to a much higher cadence can feel awkward and tiring at first. Using a
metronome or music with a certain beat can help retrain cadence. - The goal is not to eliminate vertical
oscillation (some bounce is natural and needed to store energy in tendons) but to avoid excessive,
wasteful bounce. Likewise, overly high cadence can have diminishing returns; beyond a point, very high
cadence can reduce stride length so much that it might impair efficiency or just be unsustainable.
There’s a personal optimum range. - Signs of improvement:  When a runner increases cadence, they
often report a feeling of lighter steps. If using a device, they may see metrics like “vertical oscillation” in
cm drop, and “ground contact time” might also drop slightly because each step is quicker . Impact-
related metrics like “vertical oscillation ratio” (oscillation relative to stride length) should improve.
In summary,  cadence and vertical oscillation significantly affect impact forces : a higher cadence
(with lower vertical oscillation) generally leads to lower impact shocks and a more gentle, efficient stride
. For injury-prone runners, this knowledge is empowering – it means they can actively adjust
their form to reduce injury stress. For all runners, it’s a reminder that how you run (not just how far or3031

fast)  affects  the  loads  on  your  body.  Simple  form  tweaks  like  a  small  cadence  increase  can  yield
meaningful reductions in the pounding your body takes, often with no downside to performance (and
potentially an upside). 
Next, we will delve into plyometric training  – a method used to enhance that springiness (stiffness of
tendons) we’ve been discussing – and examine how it can increase tendon stiffness and power without
necessarily adding muscle mass.
Plyometric Training and Tendon Stiffness (Without Adding
Muscle Mass)
Plyometric training, often simply called “plyometrics,” refers to exercises that involve rapid stretching
and contracting of muscles – typically jumps, hops, and bounding movements. The classic examples are
jump squats, box jumps, depth jumps (stepping off a box and immediately jumping upon landing), and
bounding drills. Plyometrics are well known to improve explosive power and are a staple for athletes in
sports requiring jumping or sprinting. But they are also highly relevant for distance runners because of
their effect on the muscle-tendon unit , especially on tendon stiffness .
One of the key adaptations from plyometric training is an increase in tendon stiffness  and improved
efficiency  of  the  stretch-shortening  cycle,  often  without  substantial  increases  in  muscle  size
(hypertrophy). This is ideal for runners: they want more springiness and power , but extra muscle mass
(especially in the legs) can be counterproductive for distance running due to the energy cost of carrying
that weight.
How plyometric training increases tendon stiffness:
When you do plyometric exercises, you are essentially training your muscles and tendons to handle
stretch loads and recoil quickly. For example, a depth jump forces the Achilles tendon to endure a quick
stretch on landing and then shorten during the rebound jump. Repeated exposure to this kind of
loading triggers adaptations: - Tendons adapt by possibly adding collagen cross-links and altering their
material properties, resulting in a stiffer tendon (meaning it deforms less under a given load). - The
neuromuscular system learns to better coordinate the muscle contraction with tendon recoil (timing the
muscle’s force production to take advantage of the tendon’s elastic return). - Muscles become better at
generating force quickly (increased rate of force development), but interestingly, plyometrics often do
this without a proportional increase in maximal strength or muscle size, indicating neural adaptations
play a big role.
Studies have demonstrated these effects. For instance, a training experiment by Hirayama et al. (2017)
had one group of men perform 12 weeks of plyometric training focusing on the ankle (depth jumps
targeting the Achilles). The results were telling: the Achilles tendon stiffness increased significantly,
while  maximal  muscle  strength  remained  unchanged .  In  other  words,  the  participants’  calf
muscles didn’t get notably stronger in a one-rep max sense, nor did they grow large, but their tendons
could  handle  loads  more  stiffly  after  training.  Functionally,  these  athletes  improved  their  jump
performance (greater rebound height, shorter ground contact times) due to the tendon becoming more
spring-like . The study suggests that the gains in performance were largely because the tendon
could store and release energy more effectively and the muscle could work in a more optimal, quick
manner – not because the muscle got bigger or could produce massively more force in a slow test.
Meta-analyses support the tendon-stiffening effect of plyometrics. A 2022 systematic review and meta-
analysis (Ramírez-Cruz et al.) found that plyometric training led to a  moderate increase in tendon
stiffness  (effect  size  SMD  ≈ 0.55)  on  average  across  studies .  At  the  same  time,  they  found39
4041

---PAGE---

plyometrics produced small-to-moderate increases in muscle fascicle length and slight increases in
muscle  cross-sectional  area  (in  some  cases),  but  not  huge  hypertrophy .  In  practical  terms,
plyometrics might make your muscles a bit more tuned (maybe slightly longer fibers, which can be
good for contraction speed), but they won’t bulk you up like heavy weightlifting would. The muscle
architectural changes (like pennation angle and fiber length adjustments) from plyo are not always
consistent – some studies show no change, some show a little change, but any hypertrophy is relatively
minor (on the order of single-digit percentage increases in muscle size) . In contrast, traditional
heavy strength training would typically cause larger muscle size gains.
There have been specific studies on Achilles tendon stiffness: some show significant increases after
plyometric regimens, others show minimal change, possibly due to differences in training intensity or
duration: - Burgess et al. (2007)  and Wu et al. (2010)  both found increases in Achilles tendon stiffness
(~5–10%) after 6-8 weeks of plyometric training . - Other researchers like Kubo et al. did not find a
change after 12 weeks in some protocols , which suggests that factors like the type of plyometric
exercise and volume or maybe initial fitness levels matter . A meta-analysis indicated that lower volumes
of plyo (<250 jumps/week) over longer periods (>7 weeks) were optimal for improving tendon stiffness
 –  essentially  emphasizing  quality  and  consistency  over  sheer  quantity  of  jumps.  -  Even  when
tendon  stiffness  doesn’t  dramatically  change  in  a  given  study,  plyo  can  reduce  tendon  hysteresis
(energy loss in the stretch-recoil cycle) , meaning the tendon springs back more efficiently.
Why is increasing tendon stiffness beneficial for runners? A stiffer tendon will stretch less under a given
force,  which  means  it  stores  and  returns  energy  more  quickly  (less  dissipated  as  prolonged
deformation). In running, a stiff tendon can make the leg spring stiffer (increasing K_leg and K_vert
potentially) which, as we discussed, can improve running economy and performance. It also can make
your stride feel more “snappy” – you spend less time on the ground and have a stronger push-off.
Indeed,  plyometric  training  often  results  in  reduced  ground  contact  times  and  increased  reactive
strength index (jump height divided by contact time) – key indicators of a more effective stretch-
shortening cycle.
Crucially, this is done without adding muscle mass  in any significant way. Endurance runners are wary
of  heavy  weight  training  because  bulking  up  muscle  could  slow  them  or  increase  energy  cost.
Plyometrics offer a way to get stronger in a functional sense (more power , stiffer springs) without
carrying much additional weight. It’s largely a neural and tendon adaptation: - Neural Adaptation:  Plyo
improves motor unit recruitment speed and coordination. For example, after plyo, the muscle might
activate  slightly  earlier  or  more  powerfully  in  the  landing  phase  to  brace  the  tendon  (as  seen  by
increased EMG activity in the later half of braking phase in Hirayama’s study) , and reduce antagonist
co-contraction (the opposing muscles relax more, which was observed as decreased tibialis anterior
activity during plantarflexion movement in that study) . - Tendon Adaptation:  Repeated stretch-load
cycles signal the tendon to remodel. There’s some evidence that collagen synthesis increases and the
tendon’s material properties change – less creep, more stiffness, possibly slight hypertrophy of the
tendon cross-sectional area in some cases (though many studies found no significant change in area,
just material stiffness). Some long-term plyo interventions did show a bit of tendon thickening, which
could accompany stiffness gains, but again not enough to weigh one down.
One interesting note: Plyometric training seems to improve what’s called the muscle-tendon behavior .
After  training,  muscle  fibers  might  contract  more  isometrically  while  the  tendon  does  more  work
(similar to how elite running works). This was observed as more tendon length change and less muscle
fascicle shortening during movements after training . That’s exactly what we want in running –
the muscle acts efficiently, the tendon does the stretchy work.4344

Plyometrics and Injury Prevention:  Increasing tendon stiffness could potentially help prevent certain
injuries by making tendons more resilient to high loads (a stiffer , stronger tendon may be less likely to
strain). However , too stiff could also be an issue if muscles can’t handle the rate of loading – it’s a
balance. Plyo also conditions muscles and joints to handle impacts better , which might reduce injury risk
from sudden loads. For example, plyometric training has been shown to reduce indicators of tendon
injury risk by teaching the tendon to handle stretch without as much hysteresis (heat buildup).
Implementing Plyometric Training for Runners:
For an amateur or injury-prone runner , plyometrics should be introduced carefully: - Start with low-level
plyometrics like jump rope, skipping, ankling, or small hops. Even simply doing some short jumps in
place focusing on quick ground contact can begin the adaptation. - Emphasize quality over quantity: a
few sets of jumps (like 2–3 sets of 10 hops) two or three times a week might be enough to stimulate
tendon adaptation, especially initially. - Rest and gradual progression are key. Tendons adapt slower
than muscles (often taking weeks to months), so one must progressively increase plyometric intensity/
volume to avoid tendonitis. - Exercises can progress from simple (in-place pogo jumps, jump rope) to
more advanced (single-leg hops, bounding, depth jumps from a small drop height) over weeks and
months. - Plyometrics can be done year-round but often are emphasized in off-season or base training
to build the reactive qualities, and then maintained with a smaller dose during peak racing season.
Semi-professional  or  well-trained  runners  often  already  incorporate  plyometrics.  They  might  do
explosive hill sprints (which are plyometric in nature), bounding drills, or specific jump exercises a
couple of times per week. They tend to reap benefits in running economy – for instance, studies have
shown plyometric training can improve 5K time or running economy in well-trained runners by a few
percent, which is significant at high levels.
Evidence of performance improvement:  A classic study by Spurrs et al. (2003) showed 6 weeks of
plyometric training improved running economy by ~4% in trained runners and also improved a 3 km
time trial performance. This was attributed to increased leg stiffness from plyo. Many subsequent
studies have echoed that plyo can improve running economy (while heavy weight training can too, plyo
has the advantage of less hypertrophy).
To sum up, plyometric training is a targeted way to increase tendon stiffness and neuromuscular
efficiency without adding muscle bulk :
- It causes tendons (like the Achilles) to become stiffer and more spring-like .
- It improves the coordination of the stretch-shortening cycle, allowing muscles and tendons to store
and release energy quickly.
- It results in minimal muscle hypertrophy; strength and power gains come from neural and tendon
changes, so a runner’s weight doesn’t significantly increase (and muscle architecture changes, if any,
may actually favor speed – e.g., slightly longer muscle fascicles) .
- The outcome for runners is often better running economy, higher reactive strength, shorter ground
contact times, and possibly a reduced injury risk due to more robust tendons.
In the next section, we will tie these topics together and offer practical guidelines – effectively creating a
“coaching manual” perspective – for different types of runners: amateurs, injury-prone runners, and
semi-professional competitors. We will discuss how an understanding of spring-mass mechanics and
stiffness can be applied in training and technique to benefit each group.3942

Practical Applications: Coaching Strategies for Different Runners
Understanding the spring-mass model and leg stiffness is one thing – applying it to training is another .
In this section, we’ll break down recommendations for different categories of runners (amateur , injury-
prone, semi-professional), as those were identified as key groups of interest. The goal is to translate the
science into usable advice that can guide coaching and training decisions.
For Amateur Runners
Profile:  Amateurs are runners who may be relatively new to running or recreational in their training
volume. They might not have an extensively developed spring-like stride yet and could be more prone
to form inefficiencies. 
Common traits and issues:  Many amateur runners exhibit a pronounced vertical bounce, overstride,
or generally have not optimized their cadence. They might lack strength in key muscle groups or
stiffness in tendons, which can make them susceptible to injuries when mileage increases or when they
try to run faster .
Strategies:
- Cadence and Form Cues:  A simple starting point is to check their cadence at an easy running speed. If
it’s  significantly  below  ~170  spm,  discuss  trying  a  slightly  higher  cadence.  Use  cues  like  “imagine
running on hot coals” (to encourage quick, light steps) or have them run with a metronome app for
short  periods  to  get  the  feel  of  a  quicker  turnover .  This  usually  reduces  overstriding  and  vertical
oscillation automatically, leading to softer landings and potentially fewer injuries. Emphasize a midfoot
landing under the body if they are severe heel-strikers causing braking, but don’t force a drastic change
– often cadence fixes a lot of that naturally. -  Strength and Plyometrics (Introductory):  Amateurs
often benefit from basic strengthening of the lower limb. Before diving into plyometrics, they should
build a base of strength: exercises like calf raises, lunges, squats, and core work help prepare the
muscles and tendons. Then, introduce low-level plyometrics: skipping rope is fantastic – it teaches quick
rebounding off the ground and is adaptable to any fitness level (start with maybe 30 seconds on, 30 off,
for a few rounds). Another drill is the “ankling” drill (short, quick steps, focusing on springing off the
forefoot). Encourage them to do perhaps two short plyometric sessions a week as part of warm-ups
(e.g., 5 minutes of various jumps). - Gradual Mileage and Surfaces:  Because their tendons might not
be as stiff or resilient, building mileage gradually is key to allowing those tissues to adapt (tendons
strengthen with repeated use, but too much too soon causes overuse injuries). Running on mixed
surfaces can also be good – a slightly softer surface (dirt trail) can reduce harsh impacts while they’re
learning, but also don’t avoid hard surfaces entirely as some exposure will stimulate adaptation (it’s
about balance). - Shoes:  A moderate shoe that isn’t overly cushioned or overly minimal is usually good
for amateurs. Extremely cushioned shoes can sometimes encourage sloppy form (since they mask
feedback), whereas a moderate shoe gives some protection but still allows them to feel if they are
pounding. Some drills in barefoot or socks on grass can heighten their perception of stiffness and
spring (when barefoot, people naturally adopt a springier , higher-cadence gait – a useful teaching tool,
used sparingly). - Education:  Teach them about the spring-mass model in simple terms. For example,
you might say: “Think of yourself like a pogo stick. If you keep your pogo stick spring firm and land with
quick bounces, you go forward efficiently. If you collapse too much on each bounce, it’s like a soft spring
that wastes energy.” Analogies can help amateurs understand why we suggest these changes. When
they feel the difference (landing softly vs hard), they’ll intuitively grasp it.
Goal:  The amateur runner should, over time, develop a stride that has a reasonable stiffness – not
floppy, not ramrod stiff – and should find that running actually feels easier when they implement these
14

---PAGE---

tips. They may notice improved times at the same effort (due to better economy) and fewer aches (due
to reduced impact).
For Injury-Prone Runners
Profile:  Injury-prone runners can be of any experience level, but they share a tendency to suffer from
overuse  injuries  (shin  splints,  knee  pain,  plantar  fasciitis,  Achilles  tendinopathy,  etc.).  Often,
biomechanical factors like high impacts, poor shock absorption, or muscular imbalances contribute.
Common issues:  These runners might have either too low stiffness (causing joint overstress and sloppy
form) or too high localized stiffness (e.g., very tight calves leading to Achilles overload). Frequently, they
might exhibit heavy heel strikes with high loading rates, or conversely, some try to overcorrect and end
up with too rigid a gait that doesn’t absorb shock.
Strategies:
- Gait Retraining:  If a runner has a history of impact-related injuries (say tibial stress fractures or knee
pain),  focus  on  reducing  their  vertical  loading  rate .  This  typically  means  working  on  increasing
cadence  and  reducing  vertical  oscillation ,  as  discussed  earlier .  A  5-10%  cadence  tweak  can
dramatically lower the forces on the tibia and knee . We often video such a runner and show
them the difference before and after: shorter stride, foot landing closer under the body, quicker rollover
–  all  correlate  with  lower  injury-producing  forces.  -  Strength/Stiffness  Imbalances:  Injury-prone
runners often have particular weak links – maybe weak hips causing poor control, or weak calves
causing over-reliance on passive structures. A targeted strength program (not just general, but based
on  their  injury  pattern)  is  key.  For  example,  for  a  runner  with  Achilles  issues,  eccentric  calf
strengthening is crucial to build tendon tolerance; for someone with runner’s knee, strengthening
quads/hips can allow them to better handle the spring forces without pain. -  Introduce Plyometrics
Carefully:  While plyometrics can increase stiffness (which is usually good for performance), with injury-
prone individuals, we must ensure they have the capacity to handle it. Low-impact plyometrics (like
hopping in place on two legs, or low step jumps) can actually  increase tendon tolerance  and stiffness,
which  could  help  prevent  injury  –  but  volume  and  intensity  must  be  low  and  progress  slow.
Counterintuitively,  some  rehab  protocols  for  Achilles  issues  include  plyometric  hops  because  they
encourage  the  tendon  to  adapt  to  loading  (under  controlled  conditions).  The  key  is  to  start  with
something  like:  2×10  easy  hops  in  place,  see  how  they  respond,  then  build  up.  -  Recovery  and
Flexibility:  While  we  focus  on  stiffness  benefits,  we  should  ensure  injury-prone  runners  maintain
adequate flexibility and recovery. A tendon that’s too stiff without muscle support could be problematic.
Encourage proper warm-ups (dynamic stretches, drills) and cooldowns (gentle static stretching, foam
rolling)  to  keep  muscle-tendon  units  healthy.  Rest  and  not  overtraining  are  obvious  but  worth
emphasizing – you want the tendon and muscles to have time to strengthen between sessions. - Form
and Footwear:  Sometimes a small form tweak can offload a trouble area. For example, a slight forward
lean and increasing cadence can reduce heel strike severity, which might relieve recurring knee pain. Or
landing a bit more midfoot can distribute load more to the arch and calf and less to the heel (helpful or
not depending on injury). Footwear can assist: e.g., a runner with chronic plantar fasciitis might benefit
from a shoe with a slight rocker and good arch support to reduce fascia strain, at least while they rehab.
However , long term, strengthening the arch (foot exercises) and gradually reintroducing normal loads
will build resilience. -  Monitoring:  Injury-prone runners should monitor metrics like pain and also
perhaps use tech (if available) that monitors impact (some insoles or footpods give impact G-force
data).  They  will  see  that  things  like  cadence  adjustments  or  plyo  training  over  weeks  are  making
tangible differences (e.g., “I noticed my average impact g’s dropped after I started focusing on softer
landings”).3031
15

---PAGE---

Goal:  The aim is to break the injury cycle by addressing the root mechanical causes. Over time, the
injury-prone runner ideally becomes a more resilient runner: tendons stiffer and stronger , muscles able
to support the joints, and running form that minimizes destructive forces. They should feel that they
can run the same distances with less soreness, and see injuries becoming less frequent or severe.
For Semi-Professional (Competitive) Runners
Profile:  These runners are already experienced, possibly competing at a high level (club, collegiate,
national levels). They typically have good running form and decent natural stiffness. Their goals are
performance-oriented – every bit of efficiency and power counts.
Common traits:  Semi-pro runners often have relatively high leg stiffness and well-developed elastic
components (from years of running, which itself conditions tendons). However , there may still be room
for improvement – especially via strength and conditioning. Additionally, some may have slight form
quirks or imbalances that if corrected could yield performance gains or prevent injuries that derail
training.
Strategies:
- Advanced Plyometric and Strength Training:  At this level, targeted plyometric training is arguably
most beneficial. They can incorporate complex plyometrics like depth jumps, single-leg bounds, hurdle
hops, and reactive drop jumps (minimal ground contact). Because these athletes likely already do some
form of S&C, periodizing plyometrics into their program is key (e.g., a plyo block in the off-season or
base phase to build explosive qualities, then maintenance during competition season). They might do
plyos 2x/week, focusing on quality (like 3×5 bounds, 3×10 box jumps, etc., high intensity, full recovery
between sets). This will seek to further increase tendon stiffness and reactive strength. Heavy weight
training (like heavy squats or calf raises) can also increase tendon stiffness and muscle power – some
coaches mix both heavy lifting and plyo in a program for middle-distance and distance runners to
maximize stiffness and strength (heavy slow loads can also increase stiffness via tendon adaptation,
albeit with some hypertrophy; the combination with plyo can yield stiffness plus power). The key is to
monitor that any muscle mass gains are minimal or at least don’t harm their strength-to-weight ratio. -
Running Form Tweaks for Marginal Gains:  At this level, big form changes are usually not advised
(their form got them this far). But small things: for example, arm carriage, posture, or ensuring they
aren’t over-striding as they get tired, can be worked on. Drills such as high knees, A-skips, and bounding
can reinforce good mechanics that keep their stiffness optimal. Many high-level runners naturally find
their optimal cadence (often 180+ spm at race pace), but if someone is an outlier (say they have an
unusually low cadence for their speed), investigating that might help. Also, focusing on a powerful but
controlled  push-off  (not  over-extending  ground  contact)  –  this  is  more  about  neuromuscular
conditioning than conscious thought at race time, which again points to plyometric and technique drills
in practice. -  Monitoring and Data:  These runners might have access to more sophisticated analysis
(force plates, high-speed video, lactate and VO₂ testing). Using these tools, a coach can measure their
stiffness parameters and economy. For instance, doing a submaximal treadmill test to measure oxygen
consumption and ground reaction forces can directly tell us their K_vert and running economy. If their
economy could be better , we might hypothesize increasing stiffness 10% could help, and design training
accordingly. It becomes a game of fine-tuning. -  Injury Prevention (High stakes):  For competitive
runners, avoiding injury is paramount to allow consistent training. Even though they are strong, the
high training loads mean tendon health is still a concern. Implement “prehab” routines: e.g., eccentric
calf drops and foot strengthening to keep the Achilles and plantar fascia robust, since they are pushing
these to the max with stiff, high-force running. Regularly assess for any signs of tendon pain and adjust
training if needed (sometimes a slight deload or a swap to more soft-surface running for a week can
ward off developing tendinopathy). - Shoes and Gear:  Semi-pros also can consider newer technologies:
e.g., carbon-fiber plated racing shoes which effectively act like an additional spring. These shoes have
16

---PAGE---

been shown to improve running economy (partly by assisting the ankle joint work and likely engaging
elastic return). Adopting these – as basically all elites have – is part of optimizing the spring-mass
behavior (the plate and foam store and release energy like an external tendon). Training in them
sparingly (to avoid altering natural stiffness too much in daily runs, since the foam can do a lot of work)
but racing in them is a strategy. Additionally, lightweight spikes or flats in workouts can condition the
legs to a higher stiffness environment (because less shoe cushioning = your body stiffens up the leg
more to compensate). -  Optimize Recovery:  Stiffness can be a double-edged sword if recovery is
lacking. High stiffness running puts stress on the system; ensuring adequate protein (for collagen
repair), sleep (growth hormone for tissue repair), and recovery modalities (like massage focusing on
muscles, since the tendons get no direct blood supply) will help keep that stiffness an asset and not
turn into an injury.
Goal:  The semi-professional runner aims to maximize the efficiency of their spring-mass system. That
means having very high (but appropriate) leg stiffness for their event – for example, middle-distance
runners may want extremely high stiffness for speed, whereas marathoners want high stiffness but also
a bit of compliance for shock absorption over long distances. By plyometric training and fine-tuning
form, they squeeze out extra percent improvements in running economy and performance. Over a 10k,
a 2-3% gain in economy can be dozens of seconds. Over a marathon, it’s minutes. At the competitive
level,  these  gains  are  the  difference  between  podiums  and  mid-pack.  So,  they  implement  these
strategies methodically and monitor their bodies closely.
Balancing Stiffness and Compliance
A final note for all levels: There is an optimal balance. Too much stiffness  can increase impact forces
beyond what tissues can handle and make the ride harsh (imagine running with knees almost locked –
you’d get injured quickly).  Too much compliance  wastes energy and can also cause injury through
excess joint motion (e.g., excessive pronation, knee valgus, etc., when things are too loose). The sweet
spot is a leg that is springy and elastic, storing energy and protecting the body, but also forgiving
enough to absorb shock and adapt to terrain.
Runners and coaches should thus aim to adjust stiffness into the optimal range: strong and springy, but
with  soft  landings.  The  strategies  above  –  cadence  adjustment,  plyometric  and  strength  training,
technique drills – are all tools to move the needle on that stiffness-compliance spectrum.
By paying attention to these details, runners can run more efficiently (faster times, less effort)  and
more safely (fewer injuries) . It truly exemplifies the mantra “train smarter , not just harder .” The science
of running biomechanics, particularly concepts like the spring-mass model and leg stiffness, gives us
the knowledge to train smarter .
Conclusion
Running might appear as simple as putting one foot in front of the other , but beneath that simplicity
lies a sophisticated spring-mass system. The  Achilles tendon and plantar fascia  work as powerful
natural  springs,  storing  and  returning  energy  each  step  to  make  running  economical .  The
concepts  of  vertical  stiffness  and  leg  stiffness  help  us  quantify  this  springiness,  and  they  have
demonstrated links to running performance – with evidence that runners who optimize their stiffness
tend to run more efficiently . 
We learned that by modifying cadence and vertical oscillation , runners can significantly alter impact
forces: a slight increase in cadence can reduce the pounding on the legs without compromising speed56

. This is an accessible change most runners can implement immediately for injury prevention
and possibly a free boost in economy. 
Furthermore,  plyometric training  emerges as a powerful method to enhance the leg’s spring-like
properties. It increases tendon stiffness and neuromuscular coordination without adding the burden of
extra muscle mass . In essence, plyometrics helps runners become bouncier and more explosive
– translating to quicker , more efficient strides on the road or trail.
For amateur runners , adopting these insights means focusing on good form habits early (like avoiding
too much bounce) and gradually strengthening their “springs” to handle more running. For  injury-
prone runners , it means making form tweaks like cadence adjustments and targeted strengthening to
break out of the injury cycle by reducing harmful forces. And for semi-professional runners , it’s about
marginal gains – refining an already decent spring system into an excellent one through advanced
plyometrics and careful technique work, shaving off precious seconds in competition.
Ultimately, running is an interplay between force, motion, and energy. By viewing the body as a spring-
mass system, coaches and runners can better understand why certain techniques or trainings yield
results.  The  spring-mass  model  and  stiffness  concepts  give  a  framework  to  diagnose  issues  (e.g.,
“Maybe my stride is too bouncy, costing me energy”) and to prescribe solutions (e.g., “I’ll do jump drills
to stiffen my legs and increase my cadence a bit”). 
The key takeaway is integration : incorporate drills and training that enhance elastic energy usage (like
plyos and strength work), tweak running mechanics for optimal stiffness (appropriate cadence, posture,
and footstrike), and always balance it with recovery and individual comfort. When done well, a runner
will feel the difference – running will seem smoother and easier , almost like the ground is giving back
energy on each stride (which, in fact, it is, via those tendons and muscles acting like springs).
Incorporating  these  principles  into  a  coaching  manual  or  training  plan  can  elevate  a  runner’s
performance while keeping them healthier . Science and practice together show that a springier runner
is often a better runner  – more efficient, faster , and less injury-prone. Whether one is lacing up for
their first 5k or competing for a championship, leveraging our natural springs to the fullest is a smart
step (or bounce) toward running success.
