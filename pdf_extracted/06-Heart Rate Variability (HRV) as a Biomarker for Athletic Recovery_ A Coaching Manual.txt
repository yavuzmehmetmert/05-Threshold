Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a Biomarker for
Athletic Recovery: A Coaching Manual
Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a powerful, non-invasive biomarker that can help coaches and athletes
gauge recovery, readiness, and overall autonomic balance. By analyzing subtle fluctuations in the time
between heartbeats, HRV provides insight into how well an athlete’s body is coping with training stress
and recovering on a day-to-day basis. In this coaching manual, we’ll break down the key concepts and
data evaluation strategies for using HRV in athletic recovery, including the different metrics (time-
domain  vs.  frequency-domain),  recognizing  signs  of  parasympathetic  saturation  and  sympathetic
overdrive (especially in overtraining scenarios), interpreting sudden versus gradual changes in HRV, and
correlating HRV patterns with sleep stages and hormonal cycles. Throughout, we’ll use a practical, data-
driven approach – referencing current research and real-world examples (like Garmin’s HRV monitoring
features) – to help you effectively integrate HRV into your coaching toolkit.
Why HRV Matters for Athletes:  During training and recovery, the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
constantly balances the  “fight-or-flight”  responses of the sympathetic branch with the  “rest-and-digest”
functions of the parasympathetic branch . HRV reflects this balance. Generally, a  higher HRV
indicates a predominance of parasympathetic activity and a well-recovered, adaptable state, whereas a
lower HRV  suggests sympathetic dominance and can signal fatigue, stress, or insufficient recovery .
This makes HRV extremely sensitive to how an athlete’s body responds to training loads and recovery
interventions. Modern wearable technologies (such as Garmin, Whoop, and others) have embraced HRV
as a core metric – for example, Garmin’s devices continuously measure overnight HRV and provide an
HRV Status  indicator to help athletes maintain a balance between training and recovery. The goal of this
manual is to help you interpret these HRV readings in context, much like a coach’s “dashboard” for an
athlete’s internal stress and recovery state.

compares the 7-day average HRV (in milliseconds) to the athlete’s established baseline range and classifies12

status as Balanced, Unbalanced (high or low), Low, or Poor. This visual provides coaches a quick indication of
whether an athlete’s autonomic recovery is within normal bounds or showing signs of strain.
Understanding HRV Metrics: Time-Domain vs. Frequency-Domain
When evaluating HRV data, it’s important to understand the different types of metrics available. HRV
can be quantified in multiple ways, but they broadly fall into two categories: time-domain metrics  and
frequency-domain metrics . Each provides unique insights into the athlete’s autonomic nervous system
status:
Time-Domain Metrics:  These metrics are derived from the direct measurements of intervals
between heartbeats (often called RR intervals or NN intervals). They capture how much
variability is present in the timing of successive heart beats over a given period. Two of the most
widely used time-domain metrics are: 
RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences):  This is the statistical root mean square
of the differences between consecutive normal heartbeats. RMSSD reflects short-term beat-to-
beat variance in heart rate and is highly sensitive to parasympathetic (vagal) activity .
In practical terms, a higher RMSSD means more variability between beats (greater vagal
influence), while a lower RMSSD means less variability (suggesting stress or fatigue). Because of
its strong correlation with high-frequency HRV and vagal tone , RMSSD (often using its
logarithm, LnRMSSD) has become the go-to daily HRV metric for many sports scientists and apps
– it is reliable even in short recordings and less influenced by breathing rate than some other
measures . Coaches like it because it’s easy to interpret: for example, a drop in an athlete’s
morning RMSSD compared to their baseline may indicate they haven’t fully recovered from
yesterday’s workout. 
SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals):  This is the standard deviation of all normal RR
intervals  in  the  recording  period.  SDNN  captures  overall  variability  and  reflects  combined
sympathetic and parasympathetic influences  over longer periods . In a 24-hour Holter
ECG, SDNN is a gold-standard metric for overall HRV; higher SDNN over 24 hours indicates a
healthy, responsive cardiovascular system. However , in the context of short-term readings (like a
1–5 minute measurement or an overnight period), SDNN is often interpreted with caution since
it can be influenced by factors like trends or slower oscillations. For athletic recovery, SDNN is
sometimes considered less sensitive than RMSSD to rapid autonomic changes. That said, a very
low  SDNN  (compared  to  population  norms  or  the  athlete’s  history)  can  indicate  an  overall
blunting of variability – potentially a red flag if seen chronically, as it might correlate with fatigue
or overtraining.
Frequency-Domain Metrics:  These metrics arise from analyzing the HRV signal in the frequency
spectrum (via algorithms like Fast Fourier Transform). Essentially, HRV fluctuations are broken
down  into  frequency  bands,  each  associated  with  certain  physiological  rhythms.  The  main
frequency-domain metrics include: 
HF (High-Frequency) Power:  This represents power in the ~0.15–0.4 Hz band, corresponding to
fast oscillations in heart rate. HF power is also known as the respiratory band  because it
encompasses respiratory sinus arrhythmia – the natural rise and fall in heart rate with breathing.
HF power is almost entirely due to parasympathetic (vagal) modulation . A high HF power
indicates strong vagal activity (often seen at rest or during recovery). For example, during deep
relaxation or during sleep, an athlete’s HF power tends to be elevated, reflecting restorative
parasympathetic dominance. Lower HF power , on the other hand, is correlated with stress,34

anxiety, or reduced vagal tone  – coaches may notice that an athlete’s HF HRV drops during
periods of intense mental or physical stress. 
LF (Low-Frequency) Power:  This corresponds to the 0.04–0.15 Hz band, which captures slower
fluctuations in heart rate. LF power is a bit more complex – it is influenced by both sympathetic
and parasympathetic activity (partly mediated by baroreflexes) . Historically, LF was
sometimes taken as an index of sympathetic activity, but it’s now understood as a mixture. For
instance, an increase in LF power might occur due to sympathetic activation or due to
parasympathetic rhythms like baroreflex oscillations; context is key. What’s important for
coaches to know is that the ratio of LF to HF  is often used as a rough indicator of autonomic
balance: 
LF/HF Ratio:  A higher LF/HF ratio has been associated with a tilt toward sympathetic
dominance (or reduced vagal tone), whereas a lower ratio suggests parasympathetic
dominance . Under controlled conditions, this ratio can hint at the body’s stress
state – for example, during exercise or competition, an athlete’s LF/HF might rise as
sympathetic drive increases. Conversely, during meditation or deep recovery, LF/HF might
fall. However, note:  The LF/HF ratio should be interpreted carefully; it’s not a perfect
measure of SNS/PNS balance in all situations . The human ANS is not a simple
seesaw – both branches can co-activate or have non-linear effects . As a coach,
you should use LF/HF as one piece of the puzzle, ideally in tandem with time-domain
measures and contextual clues (e.g., the athlete’s condition). 
(Other frequency bands: VLF for very-low-frequency and ULF for ultra-low-frequency exist, but
these require long recordings (hours to 24h) and are more relevant in clinical or research
settings for circadian trends, inflammation, etc. We won’t focus on them for daily athletic
monitoring, except to note that very long-term HRV (like 24h SDNN or ULF power) can relate to
overall health and recovery capacity .)*
Choosing the Right Metrics:  For practical athletic recovery monitoring, RMSSD (time-domain)  is often
the favored metric because it directly reflects vagal activity, is easy to compute with short readings, and
correlates well with how recovered an athlete is . Many wearables and apps therefore report an
“HRV score” based on RMSSD (sometimes a log-transformed value).  SDNN  might be looked at over
longer periods or by devices that give a single overnight HRV number (which is often akin to SDNN over
the night or the average of 5-minute SDNNs).  HF and LF  are valuable if you have access to them,
especially to understand why HRV might be changing (for example, is it a drop in HF vagal tone or a
spike in LF due to stress?). But even if you don’t see the full spectral data, remember that time-domain
and frequency-domain measures are interrelated : a high RMSSD usually coincides with high HF power
(good recovery), and a low RMSSD often coincides with a high LF/HF ratio (stress-dominant) .
Key Point:
Higher HRV (especially via metrics like RMSSD or HF power) generally means the athlete is
in a more relaxed, parasympathetically driven state – a “green light”  for readiness. Lower
HRV (e.g., low RMSSD or high LF/HF ratio) suggests the body is under stress or not fully
recovered – a potential “yellow or red light”  indicating caution . Always compare these
values to the athlete’s own baseline or normal range; individual differences are huge, so
each athlete’s trends matter more than any one absolute number .10

Parasympathetic Saturation vs. Sympathetic Overdrive:
Recognizing Overtraining Patterns
When monitoring HRV for athletes, you’ll encounter patterns that reflect how the nervous system
responds to heavy training loads. In acute fatigue and early stages of overtraining, the  sympathetic
branch often dominates (driving HRV down), a state we’ll refer to here as sympathetic overdrive . In
some cases, especially with highly trained endurance athletes, you might observe an unusual scenario
of  parasympathetic  “saturation”  or  dominance  that  blunts  HRV  responsiveness.  Let’s  define  and
differentiate these:
Sympathetic Overdrive:  This term describes a state where an athlete’s sympathetic nervous
system is chronically ramped up – essentially stuck in “fight-or-flight” mode. It often manifests as
persistently low HRV readings (and often elevated resting heart rate) over a period of days or
weeks.  Sympathetic  overdrive  can  be  caused  by  cumulative  training  stress,  life  stress,  or
inadequate recovery, and is frequently seen in  early overtraining or overreaching . Coaches
might notice that an athlete’s morning HRV is consistently depressed well below their baseline,
even after supposed rest days, coupled with reports of poor sleep or elevated morning heart
rate – these are hallmark signs of sympathetic overdrive due to fatigue. In the physiology of
overtraining, it’s noted that initially  “the autonomic nervous system tilts, with sympathetic
overdrive early on”  in the fatigue continuum . In practical terms, an athlete in this state
might feel wired but tired  – restless, easily agitated, with reduced performance and poor recovery
markers. Chronically low HRV here is a warning sign: the athlete’s body is under excessive strain
and not getting back to homeostasis. Research consistently shows that low HRV correlates with
high cortisol and stress  – the body is stuck in a catabolic, high-alert state . If you see this
pattern, it’s a cue to dial back training load and prioritize recovery (both physical and mental).
We’ll discuss algorithmic responses to this in the next section, but as a coach, sympathetic
dominance indicated by low HRV is your early alarm for potential overtraining syndrome if
unaddressed.
Parasympathetic  Saturation:  On  the  flip  side,  there  is  a  fascinating  phenomenon  where
extremely fit athletes under heavy training loads exhibit what appears to be a paradox: very low
resting heart rates, but also suppressed HRV  – which is counterintuitive, since we normally
expect low HR (a sign of fitness) to pair with high HRV. This scenario is termed parasympathetic
saturation . It refers to a situation where parasympathetic activity is indeed very high (the vagus
nerve is strongly slowing the heart), but beyond a certain point, adding more vagal input doesn’t
increase HRV and may even reduce the observed variability . In essence, the heart’s response
to acetylcholine (the vagal neurotransmitter) can reach a saturating dose – once the vagal effect
is maximal in slowing the heart, the beat-to-beat variability might actually diminish with further
vagal tone . Renowned physiologist Daniel Plews describes it as “a heightened vagal tone [that]
may give rise to sustained parasympathetic control of the sinus node, which may eliminate respiratory
heart modulation and reduce HRV” . This is critical for coaches to understand: a drop in HRV isn’t
always bad , if it occurs in the context of parasympathetic saturation in an elite athlete. In such
cases, a lower HRV during a high training load phase can be linked to positive  adaptations and
performance improvements . It sounds odd, but think of it as the athlete’s nervous system
being “too good” at applying the brake (parasympathetic) – the HRV measurement loses its
sensitivity because the heart is near its lower rate limit. When and whom does this happen to?
Parasympathetic saturation is rare and usually limited to elite endurance athletes  in periods of
very high training volume, who have very low resting HR (often in the 30s-40s) . If an athlete
meets this profile and you observe a period of suppressed HRV concurrent with low resting HR
and high performance, you might be seeing this phenomenon. One research paper noted that•

“in some circumstances, such as vagal saturation, decreases in cardiac parasympathetic indices
of HRV… can be related to positive performance outcomes and consequently reductions in HRV
should not be viewed negatively” . In practice, an athlete might feel fine and be hitting
training targets, yet their HRV is lower than normal – rather than immediately assuming they are
under stress, consider their training context.  Identifying parasympathetic saturation  often
involves looking at the relationship between HR and HRV: normally, HRV is higher when heart
rate is lower; if you see an athlete with a very low heart rate but unexpectedly low HRV (and it’s
during a big training block), this uncoupling (little or negative correlation between HR and HRV)
suggests parasympathetic saturation . Tools like HRV4Training Pro even include a feature
to check for this by plotting HRV vs. RR-interval length .
Why These Concepts Matter:  Most coaches are familiar with the straightforward case – fatigue = low
HRV (sympathetic overdrive). And indeed, the most common HRV response to overload training is a
progressive decrease in HRV, driven by sympathetic activation and insufficient recovery . But
as we’ve discussed,  “high isn’t always good and low isn’t always bad.”  An unusually high HRV can
sometimes  indicate  maladaptation  (we’ll  talk  about  this  in  a  moment  regarding  trends),  and  an
unusually low HRV in an elite endurance athlete might not always mean they are under-recovered (it
could be vagal saturation). The Garmin HRV Status feature even accounts for this: it will flag your status
as “Unbalanced – High” if your 7-day HRV average goes above  your normal range, cautioning that an
abnormally high HRV could be a sign of functional overreaching . That is essentially Garmin’s nod to
the  parasympathetic  overreaching  concept  –  a  hyper-recovery  mode  that  often  follows  heavy  low-
intensity volume. In contrast, Garmin flags “Unbalanced – Low” or “Low HRV” if the 7-day drops too low,
indicating strain .
Parasympathetic  Overtraining  vs.  Sympathetic  Overtraining:  In  sports  science  literature,
overtraining  syndrome  has  sometimes  been  classified  into  a  sympathetic  form  (more  common  in
power/speed athletes, marked by insomnia, agitation, high resting HR, low HRV) and a parasympathetic
form (more common in endurance athletes, marked by apathy, low resting HR,  relative  high HRV or
blunted HRV responsiveness). Parasympathetic saturation  as discussed is a specific case and should not
be confused as wholly benign; it’s more about recognizing that the  context matters . If an athlete is
performing well and all signs are good except HRV is oddly low with a very low HR – you might suspect
parasympathetic saturation rather than pathological overtraining. On the other hand, if performance is
declining and HRV is trending high relative to baseline (especially with lots of low-intensity training),
that could also indicate an overreaching state where the body is desperately trying to compensate by
ramping  up  parasympathetic  activity  at  rest .  In  any  case,  use  multiple  data  points:  mood,
performance,  sleep,  and  other  biomarkers  (like  morning  cortisol  if  available)  alongside  HRV  to
differentiate true overtraining from these nuances. Often, “sympathetic overdrive early on and a ‘flat’
parasympathetic pattern when depletion sets in”  is observed across the overtraining spectrum  –
meaning initially HRV falls (sympathetic dominance), and in prolonged burnout, the autonomic system
can become “flat” (little variability or responsiveness at all).
Coaching Tip:  If you suspect parasympathetic saturation  (in an elite athlete during heavy training),
one recommendation from HRV experts is to modify how you measure HRV: try a morning reading
when seated or standing instead of supine. Adding a little orthostatic stress can prevent saturating the
vagal input and yield a more sensitive HRV reading . However , if your athlete isn’t an elite or the
scenario doesn’t match, don’t jump to this conclusion – most likely a big drop in HRV is indeed due to
fatigue. Conversely, if you see signs of sympathetic overdrive  (chronically low HRV, high resting heart
rate, poor sleep), intervene with recovery strategies immediately – before it evolves into full overtraining
syndrome.23

Interpreting HRV Trends: Sudden Drop vs. Gradual Decline
HRV is a dynamic metric – it fluctuates day-to-day due to myriad factors. Not every dip or spike requires
action; what matters most are  trends  and the context of changes. A critical skill in using HRV for
coaching is distinguishing between a sudden acute change  and a gradual chronic trend , as they often
imply different things about the athlete’s condition:
Sudden Drop in HRV:  If you observe a sharp decline in an athlete’s HRV from one day to the next
(for example, a drop of >20% in their morning RMSSD or overnight HRV score compared to their
recent average), this often signals an acute stressor or fatigue . Common causes for a sudden HRV
drop include a very intense or long training session (acute training fatigue), a poor night’s sleep,
dehydration, emotional stress, or even the onset of an illness. Think of it as the body’s immediate
reaction – the sympathetic nervous system has jumped into high gear temporarily. For instance:
An athlete’s HRV might be cruising around 70 ms RMSSD, and the morning after a hard interval
session it’s 50 ms – this acute drop is the classic fatigue response and typically correlates with
muscle soreness, higher perceived fatigue, etc. Another example: an athlete is about to get sick
(viral infection); often HRV will plummet a day or two before noticeable symptoms, as the body
mounts a stress response. In fact, one study noted that “a sudden drop in HRV of more than 20%
from the individual norm preceded the appearance of symptoms of infection by an average of 3.8
days.” .  The  key  with  sudden  drops  is  that  they  are  usually  short-lived  if  the  stressor  is
removed. What should an algorithm or coach do?  Generally, acknowledge the drop but avoid
overreaction if it’s just one day – instead, adjust the day’s plan to be cautious. Many adaptive
training programs will recommend a lighter recovery workout or rest day after a big HRV drop.
This aligns with the idea of HRV-guided training: one skips or scales back high-intensity workouts
if HRV is significantly down, to allow the body to rebound. It’s worth noting that a single-night
poor HRV can happen randomly too, so context is king (was there a clear cause?). The athlete
should  focus  on  recovery  that  day  (good  nutrition,  hydration,  relaxation  techniques,  sleep).
Often, acute HRV drops rebound in a day or two if managed well . Indeed, an acute  drop
that returns to normal or above within a few days is generally considered part of the normal
training process – the so-called “fatigue then compensation” supercompensation model .
If performance isn’t suffering and the athlete feels okay, a one-off drop can simply be logged as
a sign of hard work that should be balanced with rest.  However , if an acute drop doesn’t
rebound (see next scenario), it may be the start of a trend.
Gradual Decline in HRV:  A slow, continuous downward trend in HRV over a series of days or
weeks is more concerning for cumulative fatigue or under-recovery. This is when each day HRV is
a bit lower than the last, or it remains depressed and keeps trending down relative to the
athlete’s baseline. A  persistently low HRV trend  is one of the earliest objective indicators of
overtraining or non-functional overreaching . For example, say an athlete’s 7-day average
HRV has been 70 ms, but over the last 10 days it has drifted down to 60, then 55, then 50 ms
despite no single huge drop – this kind of gradual decline suggests the athlete is not fully
recovering  between  sessions  and  stress  is  accumulating.  Research  and  practical  coaching
reports  indicate  that  “a  sustained  drop  over  several  days  may  indicate  that  the  stress  load  is
outweighing  recovery” .  In  other  words,  the  athlete  is  on  a  slow  march  toward  burnout.
Chronic sympathetic dominance  is often at play here – cortisol might be chronically elevated,
anabolic  hormones  suppressed,  and  the  athlete  might  start  to  report  persistent  fatigue,
monotony, poor mood, or plateauing performance. One guide succinctly states: “A sudden drop in
HRV may indicate acute fatigue, while consistently low HRV over weeks could signal chronic fatigue
due to prolonged stress or overtraining.” . From an algorithm perspective, seeing a downward
trend lasting 3+ days is usually time to adjust the training plan: reduce volume/intensity, add rest
days, focus on recovery modalities. Many HRV platforms use rolling weekly averages and will flag•

---PAGE---

if the weekly (or monthly) average HRV is significantly below the baseline. For instance, Garmin’s
HRV Status will classify as “Low” if your 7-day average falls well below your historical baseline
. Coaches should not ignore these trends – it’s far better to proactively deload for a few days
than to push into a major overtraining episode that could require weeks off. It’s also important
to communicate with the athlete – often they might not feel terrible initially during a decline, as
adrenaline can mask fatigue. HRV can thus serve as an early warning system: A progressive
decrease of HRV with each passing day tells you that the athlete’s autonomic resources are being
drained and not replenished .
To visualize this concept, consider two scenarios in a chart of daily HRV: 1. Acute dip and recovery:  HRV
is stable, one day it plunges, then within two days it’s back to normal or even higher (perhaps after a
rest day). This is often a healthy response to a hard training stimulus – a short-term fatigue that leads to
adaptation. 2. Chronic downward trend:  HRV is stable, then over a 2-week heavy training block it ticks
down each day. The athlete’s subjective fatigue also keeps mounting. This is a red flag – it’s the pattern
Pichot et al. observed in runners during a 3-week overload, where HRV dropped up to 43% by week 3;
when  they  deloaded  in  week  4,  HRV  recovered  and  even  overshot  baseline  as  the  athletes
supercompensated . Use such trends to time deloads and tapers effectively.
Sudden Increase in HRV:  As a brief aside, what about a sudden rise in HRV? If an athlete’s HRV
jumps much higher than normal on a given day, that can be a sign of excellent recovery or a
boost from restorative practices – but it can also sometimes be a sign of an atypical condition.
Some athletes observe an HRV spike right before they get sick (sometimes the body’s initial anti-
inflammatory response), or after an extended rest period (parasympathetic rebound). Generally,
a high HRV day isn’t problematic; just ensure it matches the context (e.g., after a recovery day, it’s
expected to see HRV higher). Exceptionally high HRV relative to baseline could, as mentioned
earlier , indicate a state of overreaching where the body is overcompensating  with
parasympathetic activity . Garmin’s classification of “Unbalanced – high HRV” is essentially
warning about this scenario. So if you see an unexplained big HRV spike coupled with the athlete
feeling fatigued or flat in performance, don’t immediately assume it’s great – it could be the
other side of the overtraining spectrum (sometimes called parasympathetic overtraining). 
Actionable Guidelines for Coaches/Algorithms:
When evaluating HRV changes, consider these steps:
Compare to Baseline:  Determine if the change (drop or rise) is outside the athlete’s normal day-
to-day variability. Many systems use a rolling baseline (e.g., last 3-4 week average). If today’s
value is more than, say, 1 standard deviation outside that range, take note. Minor fluctuations
within the normal range can be ignored or logged without action.
Identify Recent Stressors:  Correlate the HRV change with training logs and life events. A
sudden drop after a known hard training day or poor sleep night has an obvious cause – likely
acute fatigue. A gradual decline over 10 days of heavy training points to cumulative overload. If
HRV dropped without an obvious cause, probe for hidden stress (mental stress, emerging illness,
etc.).
Check Subjective and Objective markers:  Talk to the athlete or check their wellness self-
reports. Are they feeling sore, unusually tired, moody, or noticing any signs like elevated resting
heart rate or poor sleep quality? Often HRV will be reflected in these other indicators. If HRV is
low but the athlete feels amazing and is hitting personal bests, think of the parasympathetic
saturation case or a temporary anomaly; if HRV is low and they feel terrible, it’s clearly
sympathetic overdrive/fatigue.

For a sudden HRV drop , consider pivoting that day’s session to low intensity or active recovery.
Communicate to the athlete why (e.g., “Your HRV dropped big time, indicating you’re still
stressed from something – let’s do a light flush run instead of intervals and see if you rebound
tomorrow”). One or two easy days after an acute HRV drop can prevent pushing the athlete into
a deeper hole.
For a gradual decline trend , it’s time to institute a more systematic deload. You might cut back
training volume by 30-50% for a week, focus on sleep/nutrition, maybe incorporate techniques
like massage, meditation, or other recovery modalities. Use the HRV to monitor if/when it starts
to rise back toward baseline, which would indicate recovery is occurring. A rule of thumb: Don’t
schedule any new high-intensity sessions until the trend at least stabilizes or turns upward.  An athlete
in a downward HRV spiral needs a break, not another hard stimulus.
Beware of Chronic Low Plateau:  If HRV stays depressed for weeks and doesn’t improve even
after rest, this could indicate a deeper issue (illness, overtraining syndrome, or other
physiological imbalance). This might warrant medical evaluation or a very extended rest period.
In overtraining syndrome, sometimes HRV can actually normalize or even increase but with the
athlete still in a poor state (due to changes in autonomic regulation); that’s why it’s crucial to look
at performance and overall health, not just chase HRV numbers.
By interpreting sudden vs. gradual HRV changes in this way, you can use HRV as a real-time feedback
tool to periodize training intelligently. Athletes often want to push through fatigue, but the HRV trend
empowers coaches to say with confidence, “You may feel like you can keep pushing, but your nervous
system is telling a different story – let’s prioritize recovery now so you don’t crash later .” Conversely,
when HRV is trending up or consistently strong, it can green-light more intensive training blocks, since
the athlete is coping well. This adaptive approach has been shown to improve outcomes: HRV-guided
training groups often achieve better fitness gains with fewer injuries than fixed training plans .
HRV, Sleep Stages, and Hormonal Connections (Cortisol & Growth
Hormone)
Recovery isn’t just about training load – it’s heavily influenced by sleep quality  and the body’s hormonal
environment.  HRV  provides  a  window  into  how  sleep  and  key  recovery  hormones  interact.  In  this
section, we’ll explore how HRV varies across sleep stages (REM vs NREM) and what that means for
recovery, and how HRV relates to the rhythms of cortisol and growth hormone – two hormones critical
to stress and recovery.
HRV During Sleep:  Sleep is a prime time for recovery, and HRV tends to be higher at night than during
the day (assuming restful sleep). However , not all sleep is equal – there are stages: Non-REM (which
includes light sleep stages N1, N2 and deep slow-wave sleep N3) and REM (Rapid Eye Movement, dream
sleep). The autonomic nervous system behaves differently in these stages: - During  deep Non-REM
sleep (slow-wave sleep, N3) , the body is in a very relaxed, restorative state. The parasympathetic
nervous system dominates strongly. Heart rate is at its lowest and very regular , blood pressure drops,
and breathing is slow and steady. In terms of HRV:  High-frequency (HF) power increases in deep
NREM, and the overall sympatho-vagal balance shifts toward parasympathetic . In fact, deep
sleep has some of the highest vagal tone of the 24-hour cycle. Coaches will often see that an athlete’s
highest HRV readings at night coincide with periods of deep sleep. However , interestingly, because
heart rate is so stable in deep sleep, some measures of total variability might appear lower than in
lighter sleep – but beat-to-beat (short-term) variability is higher . Studies have shown that compared to
wakefulness, NREM sleep (especially N3) is associated with lower overall variability but higher beat-to-beat
vagal modulation . In simpler terms, there may be fewer drastic swings in heart rate in deep
sleep, but the influence of each breath in modulating the heart (RSA) is heightened. Most wearables5.

that track HRV will show an upward trend during periods of deep sleep on the nightly HRV graph. This is
a good sign – it means the athlete’s body is spending time in recovery mode at night. - During  REM
sleep , the scenario changes. REM is sometimes called “paradoxical sleep” because while the body is
immobile (muscle atonia), the brain is quite active (similar to awake), and there can be surges of
autonomic activity.  REM sleep tends to shift balance toward sympathetic activity . Heart rate and
blood pressure can fluctuate more in REM, and breathing becomes irregular . The HRV spectral profile in
REM shows higher low-frequency (LF) power and often a higher LF/HF ratio, indicating relatively
more sympathetic influence or reduced vagal influence . In fact, researchers often find that
parasympathetic activity decreases during REM compared to NREM , and markers of sympathetic
activity (like LF or certain stress hormones) rise . What does this mean in practice? It’s normal for
HRV (especially the RMSSD or HF component) to drop during REM-heavy periods of the night. If you look
at a continuous HRV plot overnight (as some advanced apps or devices allow), you’ll see HRV not as a
flat line but ebbing and flowing – those drops usually correspond to REM episodes or brief arousals. For
example, an athlete might average 80 ms HRV overnight, but closer inspection shows it ranged from 50
ms (during REM or awake moments) to 110 ms (during deep sleep).  Both are important  – REM is a
necessary stage of sleep for cognitive recovery, even if it’s less parasympathetically driven. But if an
athlete has very disturbed sleep (excessive awakenings, less deep sleep), often we see overall lower
overnight HRV and more of the sympathetic signature at night than desirable . - Light sleep (N1,
N2):  These intermediate stages typically also favor parasympathetic, but not as profoundly as N3. HRV
in N2 is still generally higher than in REM, but lower than in N3. It’s in flux and can be influenced by
minor awakenings.
To summarize sleep stages and HRV:  NREM (especially deep N3) = high vagal, high HRV; REM =
relatively lower HRV, more sympathetic bursts . A healthy night’s sleep cycles through NREM
and REM in roughly 90-minute cycles, and typically the first third of the night has more deep NREM
(thus often higher HRV early night), and the last third has more REM (often slightly suppressed HRV
towards morning). Coaches using devices like the Oura Ring or Garmin might note the lowest resting
heart rate and highest HRV occur in the early night when slow-wave sleep is prevalent – a sign of good
recovery. By early morning, as REM and the natural cortisol awakening response  kick in, heart rate
rises a bit and HRV may taper .
Hormonal Release: Cortisol vs. Growth Hormone (GH) and HRV:  The autonomic patterns at night tie
closely to two major hormones: -  Growth Hormone (GH):  This is the body’s primary anabolic and
recovery hormone, stimulating muscle repair , tissue growth, and regeneration. GH is predominantly
secreted during deep slow-wave sleep, especially in the first sleep cycle of the night. When an athlete
goes into deep NREM sleep, not only does vagal activity peak, but  growth hormone surges  – the
pituitary  gland  releases  a  large  pulse  of  GH  shortly  after  sleep  onset  (usually  ~30-70  minutes  in,
coinciding with the first deep sleep episode). Research has long established the  “temporal association
between SWS and GH secretion during nocturnal sleep” . This is one reason why  good sleep (and
plenty  of  deep  sleep)  is  irreplaceable  for  athletic  recovery :  you  literally  need  that
parasympathetically dominated time for GH-mediated repair processes. What does HRV tell us here? If
an athlete has a lot of high-HRV deep sleep, we can infer they likely got robust GH release. In fact,
interventions that enhance deep sleep (like certain forms of hypnosis or acoustic stimulation) have been
shown to both increase GH and tilt the ANS towards more parasympathetic activity (higher HF HRV)
during sleep . One study found that boosting SWS led to a fourfold increase in GH levels and
concomitant reduction in sympathetic markers, demonstrating the linkage between high-quality deep
sleep, high HRV, and anabolic recovery hormones .  Key point:  If your athlete’s overnight HRV
data shows strong parasympathetic activity at night, it likely means their body had the ideal conditions
to  release  hormones  like  GH  that  promote  recovery.  On  the  contrary,  if  their  sleep  is  shallow  or
frequently disrupted (hence lower HRV and higher heart rate at night), they may be missing out on
some of the GH benefits – something to address via better sleep hygiene or reduced late-day stress. -1112

Cortisol:  Cortisol is often dubbed the “stress hormone.” It is catabolic and elevates blood sugar , and
while it has normal diurnal patterns, it also rises under any kind of stress (physical or psychological).
Cortisol and HRV generally move in opposite directions: high cortisol states usually coincide with low
HRV . During a normal circadian cycle, cortisol is low at night (allowing deep sleep), then starts to
rise in the early morning hours, peaking around the time you wake up – this is called the Cortisol
Awakening Response (CAR). That morning spike in cortisol is like nature’s caffeine, mobilizing energy to
start the day, but it also is associated with a shift out of the parasympathetic recovery state. This helps
explain why in the last few hours of sleep (when REM is more frequent and cortisol is rising toward its
peak) we see HRV trending lower and sympathetic tone increasing . In other words, as morning
nears,  your  body  is  preparing  for  wakefulness  by  upping  sympathetic  activity  and  cortisol,  which
suppresses HRV . Now, in a balanced scenario, this is fine and natural. However , problems arise when
cortisol is chronically elevated at the wrong times – e.g., due to overtraining or stress, an athlete might
have elevated evening cortisol (impairing sleep and keeping HRV low at night), or a blunted morning
cortisol (indicating burnout). Overtraining research shows that in early overreaching, morning cortisol
can run high; with deeper fatigue, it may flatten  (meaning the adrenal system gets exhausted) .
Since HRV is a reflection of autonomic nervous system status, it can provide indirect clues to these
hormonal states. For instance, if an athlete’s HRV is not rising at night as it should, one possibility is that
cortisol (or other stress mediators) are too elevated when they should be low. Additionally, coaches
sometimes measure morning HRV in tandem with hormone tests; while day-to-day correlation of HRV
and cortisol can be complex, overall  there’s a negative correlation: higher baseline cortisol levels
tend  to  accompany  lower  HRV .  Some  practitioners  have  noted  that  “cortisol  levels  can  signal
impending  overtraining  long  before  physical  symptoms,”  and  one  might  catch  this  by  noticing  HRV
trending down while maybe the athlete’s subjective effort feels harder . In summary, if you see
unexplained HRV suppression, consider hormonal stress – high cortisol could be a culprit (and that
could be due to lifestyle stress, too much caffeine, illness, etc., not just training).
Integrating Sleep and Hormone Insights:  The best recovery scenario for an athlete is:  Long, high-
quality sleep with ample deep NREM  (high HRV, GH release) and normal REM (some sympathetic
activity, but not excessive awakenings). This yields a big nighttime parasympathetic surge and GH spike,
then a healthy morning cortisol peak to wake up. This athlete will likely show up in your logs with strong
overnight HRV, a well-rested morning subjective feeling, and good training readiness. On the flip side,
consider an athlete who is overreaching: they train late into the evening, have poor sleep (low deep
sleep percentage, perhaps due to high cortisol or sympathetic activation), and thus lower overnight
HRV. They might also have elevated resting heart rates at night. Their recovery hormones like GH might
be suboptimal due to reduced SWS, and their cortisol might be abnormally high at night (reducing HRV)
and then either too high or eventually flat in the morning. Over time, this pattern wreaks havoc on
recovery and performance.
As a coach, you can actually use HRV and sleep data to have very concrete discussions with athletes
about lifestyle: “I see your HRV was low most of the night and didn’t follow the normal pattern – did you have
trouble sleeping? Were you on your phone late or stressed?”  Often, fixing those issues (darkening the room,
cutting  off  screens,  relaxing  routines)  will  improve  sleep  stages  and  hence  overnight  HRV.  Some
wearables now even correlate HRV with sleep phases and give coaches a report. For example, the
athlete who has an Oura Ring might share that their deep sleep was only 30 minutes and their HRV
stayed low; that’s a flag to work on sleep habits. Another athlete might show 2 hours of deep sleep and
high HRV – a sign their body is primed for recovery (and indeed, such nights often result in better
performance the next day).
Growth Hormone and HRV in Training:  Another angle – training itself can influence GH and HRV.
Heavy resistance training or high-intensity intervals can transiently raise anabolic hormones and later
on boost deep sleep. If an athlete is recovering well, you might see their nighttime HRV actually go up20

---PAGE---

on  days  after  heavy  training,  which  sounds  counterintuitive  but  could  be  due  to  a  rebound  in
parasympathetic activity and deeper sleep to compensate (some moderate aerobic work also stimulates
parasympathetic rebound ). If you see the opposite – heavy training leads to progressively lower
nighttime HRV and poor sleep – that athlete might be under too much strain hormonally. Monitoring
HRV thus helps ensure the hormonal milieu  is conducive to adaptation, not maladaptation.
Cortisol:HRV Practical Example:  Suppose an athlete has a stressful job and you notice that even on
rest days their HRV is suppressed in the evenings (perhaps their wearable shows “Body Battery” not
recharging well, a Garmin metric influenced by HRV). This could be due to evening cortisol remaining
high from work stress, which will reduce their nighttime HRV and recovery. The coach might introduce
relaxation techniques (like guided breathing, which directly can increase HF HRV by engaging vagal
activity ) to lower sympathetic tone before bed. Over a few weeks, you might see their overnight
HRV baseline rise as those interventions pay off, indicating a healthier recovery state. They might even
subjectively report feeling more refreshed and notice performance improvements.
In summary,  HRV is interconnected with sleep physiology and endocrine function: - High HRV at the
right times (night/deep sleep) correlates with growth and recovery processes. - Low HRV at the wrong
times (night) or chronically correlates with stress hormones like cortisol being out of balance. - Use HRV
trends alongside sleep tracking to optimize an athlete’s recovery schedule. Encourage behaviors that
maximize that high-HRV deep sleep window (consistent sleep schedule, cool dark environment, etc.). -
Be mindful that  if HRV readings seem out of whack, hormones might be the hidden factor  –
consider if the athlete’s lifestyle or training is affecting their cortisol/GH rhythms. In cases of severe
overtraining, endocrine tests (cortisol, testosterone, etc.) plus HRV can provide a fuller picture: often
you’ll  see  low  HRV  and  elevated  cortisol,  or  in  burnout,  paradoxically  low  cortisol  (adrenal  fatigue
concept) with flat HRV.
Practical Coaching Strategies for Evaluating HRV Data
Finally, let’s compile some practical guidelines – a step-by-step coaching manual on how to evaluate and
apply HRV data for your athletes:
1. Establish Individual Baselines and Normal Ranges
Every athlete is unique. HRV norms are highly individual – what’s “high” for one person might be
“average” for another . So, first ensure each athlete has a baseline. Have them record HRV regularly
(many coaches use a consistent morning measurement, or rely on nightly wearable data). After about
2-3 weeks, you’ll have a sense of their typical range . For example, Athlete A might usually be
around 30–50 ms RMSSD, Athlete B around 70–90 ms. Document these along with subjective notes.
Many devices automatically compute this personal baseline (Garmin requires ~3 weeks of nightly data
to establish HRV Status baselines ). When interpreting data, always frame it as “relative to  their
norm.” A raw HRV of 40 ms could mean fine for one athlete, but for another it could be alarmingly low.
Also  track  their  variation  –  some  people  are  naturally  more  variable  day-to-day,  others  are  very
consistent. Knowing this helps distinguish meaningful changes from noise .
2. Use Both Acute Readings and Trends
Check the daily HRV readings (or the overnight average) for acute signals, and review weekly trends: -
Daily Check:  Look at this morning’s HRV (or last night’s). Is it outside the athlete’s normal band? Use a
simple color-coding or notation: green for within/above baseline, yellow for slightly below, red for
significantly below. Many apps do this automatically. Daily checks tell you if something immediate is up52

---PAGE---

(e.g., a big drop). -  Trend Check:  Look at the rolling 7-day or chronic trend. Is there a monotonic
decline? Or perhaps an improving trend? For example, you might notice “This week is trending lower
than last week on average.” Trends are often more reliable indicators of whether the training load is
sustainable.  A  one-day  low  HRV  can  happen  randomly,  but  a  week-long  low  is  likely  real  fatigue.
Garmin’s HRV widget, for instance, shows the 7-day trend against baseline and flags “Balanced” vs
“Unbalanced” . Aim for balanced most of the time – if it’s unbalanced high or low for too long,
adjust training. -  Coefficient of Variation (CV):  An advanced concept some coaches use is the CV of
weekly HRV – basically how much HRV bounces around day-to-day. An elevated CV (very erratic HRV)
along with a drop in average can indicate accumulating fatigue . A stable or reducing CV with a
steady high HRV is a good sign. In team sports, monitoring the whole squad’s HRV trends can even
predict who might be at risk of injury or illness, as those with downward trends are the ones to perhaps
pull back on.
3. Correlate with Training Phases and Performance
Contextualize HRV with what’s going on: - In a high load training block , expect HRV to drop somewhat
– that’s normal as long as performance is maintained. But you want it to rebound after deload weeks. If
HRV keeps dropping week after week through what should have been a recovery week, the athlete
might be not absorbing the training. - In a taper or rest phase , HRV should climb (or return to baseline
from any suppressed state). Many athletes see their highest HRV on rest days or toward end of a taper –
indicating freshness. If HRV isn’t coming up with rest, suspect lingering stress or incomplete recovery. -
Before competition:  Some athletes get pre-competition anxiety that lowers HRV acute (fight-or-flight
response) . This doesn’t necessarily harm performance if it’s just excitement – e.g., an Olympic lifter
might hit a PR even with low HRV that day due to adrenaline. So don’t overreact to a single low number
on race day if the athlete feels ready. It might be normal psych-up. On the other hand, if an athlete is
over-trained, HRV might be chronically low and performance is down. - Performance outcomes:  Use
HRV alongside metrics like times, power outputs, and subjective ratings. Over time, you might see
patterns: “Whenever HRV is below X, you struggle in the workout.” or “When HRV is high, your intervals
go great.” This individualizes the meaning. Some studies even found improved performance in groups
that only did intense training when HRV was above baseline . You can experiment with HRV-
guided session planning for willing athletes.
4. Identify Patterns Unique to the Athlete
Some athletes might have consistently low morning HRV but still do fine – perhaps their HRV rises more
at night. Others might be very sensitive to travel or dehydration (which tank HRV). For example, you
might notice every time an athlete takes a transatlantic flight, their HRV drops 15% for two days – so
next time, you proactively plan recovery days after travel. Or an athlete’s HRV might dip specifically after
heavy strength sessions more than after long runs – indicating what type of stress hits their system
hardest. Over months, these insights allow truly personalized coaching. 
Also note any parasympathetic saturation candidates : if you coach elite endurance athletes, keep an
eye out for the low HR + low HRV combo during mega mileage weeks. If you confirm it’s not illness or
true overtraining (i.e., they feel good and perform well), you might adjust their HRV measurement
routine (e.g., measure upon standing) for better sensitivity as discussed earlier . This is an exception, but
valuable to remember .
5. Educate and Involve the Athlete
Make sure the athlete understands why you’re using HRV and what it means. This helps compliance (like
wearing the device regularly, or doing the morning measurement properly). It also prevents them from6061
6263

6566
12

---PAGE---

freaking out at normal fluctuations. Emphasize that HRV is not a “grade” but a feedback tool. For
instance, if they see a red low HRV, it’s not “bad” in a moral sense – it’s information that they should
respond to. Many athletes become motivated when they see HRV improvements with better recovery
practices. You can set up friendly challenges, e.g., “Let’s see if more hydration and an extra hour of sleep
this week bumps your HRV back into green.” When athletes take ownership, you get better data and
better outcomes.
6. Integrate HRV with Other Recovery Indices
HRV shouldn’t be used in isolation. Always consider it alongside: -  Resting Heart Rate (RHR):  Often,
high RHR + low HRV is a stronger flag for fatigue than either alone. A normal HR with low HRV might be
more parasympathetic saturation or measurement nuance. Many systems combine these (e.g., some
readiness scores use both). -  Sleep metrics:  As detailed, poor sleep will show up in HRV. Use the
qualitative (hours, sleep stages) with HRV to fully assess recovery. If HRV is off, check if the athlete only
slept 4 hours, etc. - Subjective scores:  Don’t ignore how the athlete says they feel. HRV is great but not
infallible. If an athlete’s HRV is low but they swear they feel amazing and their performance is peaking,
you must interpret the data in context (maybe it’s taper anxiety or that rare parasympathetic blunting).
Conversely,  if  HRV  is  normal  but  they  feel  terrible,  investigate  –  the  HRV  might  be  temporarily
maintained but other systems are lagging (e.g., psychological stress can sometimes not immediately
reflect in morning HRV). -  Other Biomarkers:  If available, things like blood markers (e.g., cortisol,
testosterone:cortisol ratio, CK for muscle damage, etc.) can corroborate HRV findings. For example,
consistently low HRV and consistently high cortisol would strongly indicate overtraining risk .
Use HRV as the accessible daily marker , and periodic blood tests as needed for confirmation in high-
level cases.
7. Avoid Common Pitfalls
Panicking Over One Low Value:  Don’t scratch a key workout just because one morning HRV
was low – look for confirmation in how the athlete feels and tomorrow’s reading. It’s the
sustained low trend that is more important. One low value could even be a sensor error or an
artifact of a late dinner or some acute stress that might resolve.
Forgetting the Big Picture:  HRV is one aspect of training feedback. If an athlete’s HRV is slightly
down but everything else says they’re fine (great mood, great performance, normal RHR), you
might simply monitor a bit more rather than change course. Conversely, if HRV is fine but other
signs of fatigue are present, don’t let a good HRV lull you into overtraining someone. There are
times HRV can stay artificially high – e.g., some overtrained states or if someone is tapering and
starting to detrain, HRV might rise but performance can drop. So, context!
Not Standardizing Measurements:  If you do morning readings, ensure the athlete does it the
same way each time (same time of day, same posture, ideally after waking and voiding but
before coffee or exercise). Changes in routine (one day they measure standing rushing to work,
another day lying in bed) can cause variability unrelated to recovery. If using wearables, ensure
they wear it consistently and the device has a good signal. The more consistent the data source,
the more trust you can place in trends.
8. Leverage Technology but Maintain Coach’s Intuition
Devices like Garmin, Whoop, Polar , etc., now provide readiness scores that crunch HRV, sleep, and other
metrics into simple labels (e.g., “Recovery: 32% – pay attention!” or “Training Readiness: High”). These
are useful summaries, especially for athletes who may not dive into the raw data. As a coach, use those
as a starting point, but always apply your judgment. Sometimes you will deliberately override a metric –
for example, an athlete has a big competition and the system says “recovery low”; you’re not going to1951

---PAGE---

tell them to skip the competition! Instead, you’d adjust strategy (longer warm-up, mental focus, etc.,
acknowledging  they’re  not  100%).  In  many  cases,  though,  these  systems  help  reinforce  your
recommendations: if you tell an athlete to rest and their watch also flashes a low readiness score, they’ll
be more likely to comply.
9. Use HRV Biofeedback for Recovery
Not only can HRV measure recovery, it can be a training tool  for recovery. Practices such as deep
breathing exercises, meditation, or HRV biofeedback sessions can increase HRV acutely and help an
athlete shift into a parasympathetic state. Some athletes use guided breathing apps that show in real
time their HRV (often using a chest strap) and try to maximize it via slow, diaphragmatic breathing. This
is like training the recovery system. It can be especially useful for athletes who struggle to unwind
(those with high sympathetic drive). Even 5-10 minutes of slow (6 breaths per minute) breathing can
raise HF HRV and potentially improve subsequent sleep or recovery . Encourage these habits as
part of the overall recovery plan.
10. Monitor Long-Term Progress
Over the course of a season or year , hopefully you see the athlete’s baseline HRV either hold or even
improve slightly as their fitness and resilience increase. Many times, effective training will raise resting
vagal tone – some studies show athletes who improved VO₂max also saw progressive increases in HRV
. If you see a long-term downward drift in baseline HRV over months, that could indicate the
training program is too stressful without enough rest (or other lifestyle factors are degrading their
recovery capacity). Intervene accordingly. On the flip side, if an athlete’s baseline HRV climbs too much
above their norm and stays there, check if they are detraining (sometimes reduced training load or
illness can paradoxically raise HRV short-term). The optimal zone is a stable or slowly improving HRV
baseline  that  correlates  with  performance  improvements.  Remember ,  the  ultimate  goal  is
performance , not maxing out HRV – HRV is a means to ensure the athlete is adapting well. As one
paper pointed out, athletes who personalized their training based on HRV got better results with less
risk  – a win-win.
Conclusion:  By differentiating between time- and frequency-domain HRV metrics, you gain a full picture
of  an  athlete’s  autonomic  function;  by  understanding  phenomena  like  sympathetic  overdrive  and
parasympathetic saturation, you can correctly interpret HRV changes in the context of overtraining; by
distinguishing sudden drops from gradual trends, you can take timely action to prevent minor fatigue
from becoming major burnout; and by linking HRV with sleep and hormonal patterns, you appreciate
why recovery is a 24-hour process influenced by nighttime restorative phases. 
In applying this knowledge, you transform HRV from just a number on a screen into a rich decision-
support tool. It’s like having an ongoing conversation with the athlete’s nervous system: it tells you
when to push, when to pull back, and when something might be wrong under the hood. Listen to it,
corroborate it with the athlete’s feedback, and adjust the training plan proactively. The result will be
athletes who train hard and smart – maximizing adaptation while minimizing the risk of overtraining.
And  as  a  coach,  there’s  nothing  more  satisfying  than  seeing  your  athletes  thrive,  armed  with  the
insights that data like HRV provides, backed by the wisdom of careful analysis and responsive training
adjustments.
