Athletes training at an altitude of ~1,856 m in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Endurance athletes often utilize high-
altitude venues to stimulate physiological adaptations that can enhance sea-level performance.
Altitude Training: Physiology and Practical
Coaching Guide
Altitude training – also known as hypoxic training – is a method used by endurance athletes to improve
performance at sea level by living or exercising in low-oxygen environments. At elevations typically
above ~1,500–2,400 m (5,000–8,000 ft), the air contains the same 20.9% oxygen as at sea level, but
barometric pressure  is lower , reducing the  partial pressure of oxygen  in each breath . This
relative lack of oxygen (hypoxia) triggers a cascade of physiological responses as the body acclimatizes.
Endurance  athletes  leverage  these  adaptations  –  such  as  increased  red  blood  cell  production  and
improved oxygen delivery – to gain a competitive edge when they return to sea-level conditions .
Altitude training gained prominence after the 1968 Mexico City Olympics (~2,240 m altitude), where
endurance performances suffered while sprint events saw less impact, highlighting the influence of
altitude on aerobic exercise . Since then, coaches and sport scientists have refined altitude training
protocols to maximize benefits and minimize drawbacks, leading to strategies like "Live High, Train
Low"  to  optimize  training  intensity  alongside  altitude  exposure.  In  this  guide,  we  detail  the
physiological effects  of altitude training – especially the role of erythropoietin (EPO) and increased
hemoglobin mass – and compare the popular  “Live High, Train Low” (LHTL)  and  “Live High, Train
High” (LHTH)  models. We also examine how acute altitude exposure affects sleep quality , metabolic
rate , and recovery , and provide practical advice on adjusting training heart rate and pace zones  for
athletes  training  at  altitude.  This  comprehensive  overview  is  intended  for  coaches  and  endurance
runners (from amateur to semi-professional) to understand the science and best practices of altitude
training for improved sea-level performance.
Physiological Effects of Altitude Training on Performance
Altitude training can confer significant aerobic performance benefits primarily by enhancing the blood’s
oxygen-carrying capacity and efficiency of oxygen utilization. The central premise is that prolonged
exposure to hypoxia stimulates erythropoiesis  (red blood cell production), leading to more hemoglobin
and red blood cells, which in turn deliver more oxygen to working muscles during exercise .
When  an  altitude-acclimatized  athlete  returns  to  sea  level,  they  arrive  with  these  physiological
“upgrades,” potentially allowing them to sustain a faster pace or higher power output before fatigue. In
this section, we break down the key physiological adaptations to altitude and how each can enhance
sea-level endurance performance:
Increased Red Blood Cell (RBC) Mass and Hemoglobin:  The hallmark adaptation to altitude is
an increase in total red blood cell volume and hemoglobin mass . With fewer oxygen
molecules available in each breath of thin air , the kidneys respond by ramping up production of
the hormone  erythropoietin (EPO)  via the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. EPO then
stimulates the bone marrow to produce more RBCs. Over a period of weeks at altitude, athletes
commonly see a measurable rise in hemoglobin concentration and total hemoglobin mass
. Multiple studies and meta-analyses confirm this effect; for example, a 2025 systematic
review  found  that  altitude  training  significantly  increased  hemoglobin  concentration
(standardized mean difference ~0.7) and tended to increase total hemoglobin mass compared to12

sea-level training . The magnitude of increase depends on altitude “dose” (height and
duration): a classic rule of thumb is roughly a 1% increase in total RBC mass per 100 hours of
moderate altitude exposure . Practically, about 3–4 weeks at altitude often yields a ~4–7%
increase in hemoglobin mass in athletes . For instance, living ~3 weeks around 2,300 m
elevation can expand Hb_mass by on the order of 4–5% . This is significant because each 1 g
increase in hemoglobin mass is associated with ~4 mL/min greater  VO₂max  (a higher aerobic
capacity) . In simple terms, more red blood cells equate to more oxygen delivered to muscles,
which can improve endurance performance at sea level. However , it’s worth noting there is
individual variability – some “high responders” see large RBC boosts (up to ~10–12%), while
others  (“non-responders”)  see  minimal  change .  Overall,  though,  the  erythropoietic
response  is considered the primary factor behind altitude training benefits .
EPO Pathway (Hypoxia to Erythropoiesis):  Understanding the EPO pathway helps illustrate
why altitude triggers RBC gains. At sea level, the kidneys constitutively produce a baseline level
of EPO. In hypoxic conditions, specialized kidney cells sense reduced blood oxygen and stabilize
HIF-1α/HIF-2α  transcription factors (normally, adequate oxygen causes HIF breakdown) .
Stabilized  HIF  (particularly  HIF-2α)  binds  to  hypoxia  response  elements  on  the  EPO  gene,
dramatically increasing EPO mRNA transcription . Within hours of arriving at high altitude,
blood EPO levels begin to climb; studies have observed detectable EPO increases within ~2 hours
of exposure to hypoxia . EPO concentrations typically  peak after about 24–48 hours  at a
sustained altitude, often reaching several times baseline values . After this initial surge, if
altitude exposure continues, EPO levels may moderate back toward baseline over the next days
as new red cells are produced (a feedback mechanism such that severe hypoxia is needed to
keep  EPO  elevated) .  Nevertheless,  the  early  EPO  surge  is  sufficient  to  “trigger”  robust
erythropoiesis. New reticulocytes (young red blood cells) start appearing in the bloodstream
about 3–5 days  after ascent as the bone marrow responds . Over the next 1–3 weeks, those
reticulocytes  mature  into  fully  functional  erythrocytes,  and  total  RBC  mass  progressively
increases. For example, one study found about a 2% increase in total hemoglobin mass after
10 days  at ~2300 m, and a ~4–5% increase after 3 weeks  at that altitude . Notably, studies of
4-week  exposures  at  ~2300  m  did  not show  a  plateau  –  hemoglobin  mass  was  still  rising,
suggesting longer stays or higher altitudes could yield further gains . The practical upshot: a
typical  3–4  week  altitude  camp  (a  common  duration  for  elite  training  camps)  is  enough  to
significantly boost an athlete’s oxygen-carrying capacity. When the athlete returns to sea level
with extra RBCs, their muscles receive more oxygen for a given cardiac output, delaying fatigue
and improving aerobic performance. This ergogenic effect is often most pronounced in the first
10–14 days  after returning from altitude, as the body gradually re-equilibrates (excess RBCs will
slowly be lost or broken down if they are above what is needed at sea level) . Coaches often
plan important races within this window to capitalize on the “altitude boost.” It’s important to
mention that while raising RBC count is beneficial, it also increases blood viscosity slightly; the
body naturally limits extreme increases. (In contrast to illicit EPO doping or transfusions which
can overshoot safe RBC levels, altitude training yields a moderate, physiologically regulated
increase.)
Plasma Volume and Early Acclimation:  In the first days at altitude, before new RBCs kick in, the
body  undergoes  other  changes.  One  acute  response  is  a  diuresis  and  plasma  volume
reduction . Hypoxia causes increased respiration and mild dehydration; within a day at altitude,
plasma volume can drop by ~5–10%, concentrating the blood (hemoglobin concentration rises
even though total RBC hasn’t yet) . This hemoconcentration  temporarily  increases oxygen
transport per unit blood volume, but it comes at the cost of a smaller total blood volume, which
can  reduce  cardiac  stroke  volume  and  thus  limit  maximal  cardiac  output .  Over  longer
acclimation,  plasma  volume  may  partially  restore,  especially  if  hydration  and  nutrition  are1112

maintained, but it often remains slightly below sea-level values. The net effect is that true gains
in  oxygen-carrying  capacity  only  come  once  new  RBCs  are  produced ;  the  initial  spike  in
hemoglobin concentration from plasma loss is not the same as a real increase in hemoglobin
mass .  Coaches  should  be  aware  that  athletes  often  experience  heavier  or  “thicker”
feeling blood in the first days due to reduced plasma – emphasizing hydration is key (addressed
later).
2,3-BPG and Oxygen Unloading:  Altitude triggers biochemical adaptations in the blood that
improve  oxygen  delivery  to  tissues.  Notably,  hypoxia  leads  to  elevated  levels  of  2,3-
bisphosphoglycerate  (2,3-BPG)  in  red  blood  cells .  2,3-BPG  binds  to  hemoglobin  and
reduces its affinity for oxygen, causing a rightward shift of the O₂–hemoglobin dissociation
curve . This means that at a given partial pressure, hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily to
the muscles. Initially, upon acute ascent, the opposite happens due to respiratory alkalosis (from
hyperventilation, CO₂ drops and blood pH rises causing a temporary leftward shift) . But
within a day or two at moderate altitude, renal compensation for pH and an increase in 2,3-BPG
result in a net rightward shift , facilitating oxygen unloading in tissues . In simpler terms,
the body “learns” to extract what oxygen is available more efficiently. This increased oxygen
unloading capacity persists upon return to sea level for a period, complementing the higher
oxygen carrying capacity. The SimpliFaster coaching resource notes that altitude living increases
2,3-BPG , which “stabilizes deoxygenated hemoglobin, allowing for greater oxygen release to
working  muscles” .  This  helps  offset  some  of  the  performance  loss  in  hypoxia  and  is
beneficial back at low altitude – effectively, the muscles can uptake oxygen more readily from the
blood.
Muscle  and  Metabolic  Adaptations:  In  addition  to  blood-based  changes,  chronic  altitude
exposure induces adaptations in muscle tissue that can enhance endurance. Research suggests
that training in hypoxia can increase  capillary density  and  mitochondrial density  in muscle,
similar to classic endurance training stimuli . The idea is that hypoxia may upregulate factors
like  VEGF  (vascular endothelial growth factor , via HIF pathways) leading to angiogenesis (new
capillaries), and stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis to improve oxygen utilization. Over a multi-
week altitude training camp, an athlete is concurrently doing high-volume training, so it’s hard to
parse altitude-specific effects versus normal training adaptations. However , some studies find
that altitude amplifies certain signals: for example, altitude-trained muscles sometimes show
increased  activity  of  oxidative  enzymes  and  a  greater  reliance  on  carbohydrate  metabolism
(since carbohydrate yields more ATP per oxygen than fat). Anecdotally and empirically, altitude
training  can  improve  an  athlete’s  exercise  efficiency  –  the  muscle  efficiency  in  low-O₂
conditions  improves, which might stem from mitochondrial adaptations or fiber type shifts. As
the COROS Altitude Guide notes, “muscle efficiency under oxygen-limited conditions improves”
and  lactate threshold  may rise with acclimation . There is a phenomenon known as the
“lactate  paradox”  observed  at  altitude:  after  acclimatization,  exercising  at  a  given  absolute
intensity results in lower blood lactate than expected, possibly because of muscle metabolic
adjustments  and  increased  oxygen  delivery.  When  returning  to  sea  level,  a  higher  lactate
threshold and economy can translate to better performance. It should be noted that extremely
high altitudes (above ~5000 m) are actually detrimental to muscle mass and function – extended
stays can cause muscle atrophy  and reduced muscle fiber cross-sectional area due to chronic
hypoxia and malnutrition . But the moderate altitudes used in training (usually 1,800–2,800 m
for camps) strike a balance where muscle aerobic machinery is enhanced without significant
atrophy (assuming caloric intake is sufficient).
Ventilatory and Cardiorespiratory Adaptations:  One of the immediate  reactions to altitude is
hyperventilation  –  breathing  faster  and  deeper  to  take  in  more  oxygen.  This  is  driven  by2019

chemoreceptors sensing low arterial O₂. Initially, hyperventilation causes decreased CO₂ (hence
the alkalosis mentioned), but over a few days the kidneys compensate by excreting bicarbonate
to normalize pH . After acclimatization, ventilation at rest and submaximal exercise remains
elevated relative to sea level, which improves arterial oxygenation. Altitude-acclimatized athletes
also often have a higher breathing capacity and ventilatory efficiency when they return to sea
level, meaning they can sustain higher ventilation if needed during maximal exercise (though at
sea level they might not need to). Additionally, resting and submaximal heart rate  increase at
altitude  as  part  of  the  acute  response:  the  body  raises  cardiac  output  via  heart  rate  to
compensate for lower oxygen per beat . This is largely a sympathetic nervous system effect –
hypoxia triggers increased sympathetic drive (and reduced parasympathetic tone), leading to
higher heart rates and blood pressure for a given workload . Interestingly, very well-trained
endurance athletes sometimes exhibit a blunted initial heart rate response (their bodies are so
efficient that on  day 1  at altitude, heart rate doesn’t rise as much, which can actually impair
oxygen delivery until other adaptations catch up) . Over 1–2 weeks, the resting heart rate
tends to come back down a bit as the body acclimates, but it may stay slightly above sea-level
baseline. Stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped per beat) tends to decrease at altitude
(due to reduced plasma volume and faster heart rate reducing filling time) , so maintaining
cardiac output relies on that higher heart rate. The net effect is that for any given submaximal
running speed at altitude, an athlete’s heart rate is higher  than it would be at sea level .
Despite acclimatization, VO₂max is always somewhat lower at altitude  than at sea level for the
same individual, because even with adaptations, the absolute oxygen availability is limited. A
well-known approximation is a ~6–7% drop in VO₂max per 1000 m  gain in elevation (above ~300
m) for an unacclimatized person . Acclimatization improves this, but even after 3 weeks at
2300 m, athletes’ VO₂max and aerobic performance might remain ~6% below their sea-level
values . In other words, you can partially adapt, but you can’t fully negate the performance
decrement while at altitude . This is why altitude-trained athletes might still find it hard to race at
altitude; however , when they go  down  to sea level, they have both normal oxygen availability
and their altitude-induced physiological enhancements, yielding a performance boost.
Key  Takeaway  –  Altitude  Physiology:  Through  sustained  altitude  exposure,  the  body  adapts  by
producing more red blood cells and hemoglobin (via the EPO pathway), increasing oxygen delivery
capacity. It also adjusts ventilation, heart rate, and muscle metabolism to more effectively use the
scarce oxygen. These changes collectively enhance endurance aerobic capacity  and can translate to a
1–5%  improvement  in  sea-level  performance  after  a  proper  altitude  training  phase .  For
instance, living high for ~4 weeks has been associated with ~1–2% gains (and sometimes up to ~5%) in
race performance at sea level . The primary drivers are hematological (more RBCs), supported by
muscular and cardiorespiratory adaptations that improve oxygen extraction and utilization. However ,
maximizing these benefits requires carefully managing how one trains at altitude, which brings us to
the different models of altitude training.
Altitude Training Models: Live High–Train Low vs Live High–Train
High
When incorporating altitude into a training program, there are several models to choose from. The two
most common paradigms for endurance athletes are:
Live High, Train Low (LHTL)  – Living  at a high altitude to induce physiological adaptations, but 
training  at lower altitude (or sea level) to maintain higher exercise intensity.
Live High, Train High (LHTH)  – Living and training  entirely at altitude, so the body is
continuously in a hypoxic environment for both rest and exercise.28

Both approaches aim to capitalize on altitude acclimatization (the “live high” part ensures adequate
hypoxic dose to trigger EPO and other adaptations). The key difference lies in the training environment.
We will examine each approach, their pros and cons, and what research shows about their effectiveness
for improving sea-level performance.
Live High, Train Low (LHTL)
Concept and Rationale:  The LHTL model was developed to solve a dilemma: while altitude living
stimulates red blood cell production and other adaptations, exercising at altitude can be problematic
because the lower oxygen availability forces athletes to train at slower speeds or lower power outputs
than  they  could  at  sea  level.  LHTL  gets  around  this  by  having  athletes  sleep  and  reside  at  a
moderately  high  altitude  (typically  2,000–2,500  m  elevation)  but  travel  down  to  lower  elevations
(below ~1,250 m, or use oxygen-enriched environments) for their key workouts . The idea is to
“get the best of both worlds” – the athlete’s body acclimates and increases EPO/RBC from living high,
but they can still hit near sea-level training paces and quality during intense sessions, because they
perform those at low altitude where oxygen is less limiting . This helps avoid the detraining or
compromised intensity that can occur with full-time altitude training.
Implementation:  An example LHTL setup might be: an athlete lives and sleeps at a mountain location
at 2200 m, but each day they drive down to 1000 m for track workouts, or use a supplemental oxygen
setup/tent  during  training.  Some  elite  training  bases  are  specifically  situated  to  allow  this  (e.g.
Mammoth Lakes, CA or Flagstaff, AZ have higher living quarters and lower valleys nearby) . Another
way to implement LHTL without travel is using an altitude tent or altitude house only for sleeping
(simulating high altitude at night) and doing all training outside at sea-level oxygen. Research indicates
that to be effective, the “living high” portion should be at least  ~12–16 hours per day  in hypoxia for
several weeks, to accumulate enough altitude exposure for robust RBC increases . Often athletes will
live high almost full-time (except when training) for 3–4 weeks in a row.
Physiological and Performance Effects:  Studies generally support that LHTL can produce the desired
hematological adaptations. By living at ~2,200 m for instance, athletes see elevated EPO and increased
red cell mass after a few weeks, similar to a traditional altitude camp . Crucially, because high-
intensity workouts are done low, the athlete can maintain sea-level caliber training paces and power
outputs, preserving neuromuscular adaptations and race-specific intensity. This often leads to improved
performance  upon  returning  to  competition  at  sea  level.  In  fact,  a  number  of  experiments  have
compared LHTL vs LHTH: A review by Muraoka and Gando (2012) concluded that LHTL yielded greater
improvements  in  sea-level  endurance  performance  than  LHTH,  even  though  both  protocols
produced  similar physiological adaptations  in terms of RBC increase . The LHTL groups in
various studies showed about a 1–4% performance improvement  (in events ranging ~30 seconds up
to  ~17  minutes  in  duration)  compared  to  control,  whereas  LHTH  groups  often  showed  smaller  or
inconsistent gains . This 1–4% boost can be the difference between, say, a 32:00 10K runner and
a 31:00 – a significant competitive edge. LHTL has also been suggested to potentially aid anaerobic
performance (sprints) slightly, as athletes keep doing high-quality sprint training at low altitude while
perhaps benefitting from altitude-induced erythropoietic effects at rest . The U.S. Olympic trials and
other elite observations have noted many athletes performing very well ~10 days post an LHTL camp.
Practical  Considerations  –  Pros  and  Cons:  The  main  advantage  of  LHTL  is  that  it  mitigates  the
negatives of training in hypoxia. Athletes often report feeling strong in workouts (since those are done
in richer air) and still reaping altitude benefits. It’s psychologically easier to hit target times, which helps
confidence. Recovery from intense workouts may also be better at low altitude than it would be high up
(more on recovery in a later section). On the downside, LHTL can be logistically challenging . It requires
either geographic proximity of high and low altitudes or use of artificial altitude systems (tents, hypoxic3637

rooms).  Athletes  might  spend  time  commuting  between  elevations,  which  can  be  tiring.  Using  an
altitude tent at home is an option many use – sleeping in a low-oxygen tent simulates living ~2,000–
3,000 m; then you emerge and train normally during the day. Such tents are expensive and some
athletes find sleeping in them uncomfortable (limited space, heat, noise from compressors). Another
consideration is that LHTL still demands staying at altitude for long periods each day, which can cause
disturbed sleep or other altitude-related stresses when not training (discussed in Altitude Challenges
below). Opponents of altitude training have pointed out that any RBC gains eventually dissipate after a
few weeks back at sea level , and they argue if one cannot maintain training intensity at altitude it
“wastes” training time. LHTL addresses the latter concern well, which is why it’s a preferred method
among many coaches. Overall, when done properly, LHTL is considered the “optimal” altitude training
model for sea-level performance  in endurance sports , because it maximizes physiological
adaptation while minimizing compromises in training quality.
Live High, Train High (LHTH)
Concept and Rationale:  The traditional approach to altitude training is LHTH, where an athlete both
lives and trains at altitude  continuously. This is naturally what happens when, say, a team goes to a
mountain training camp and stays there full-time (or for athletes who already reside at altitude year-
round). The logic is straightforward: constant exposure  to hypoxia, both at rest and during exercise,
may amplify some adaptation signals. Training in hypoxia could theoretically add an extra stimulus to
muscles (forcing them to work with less oxygen might induce adaptations that training in normoxia
wouldn’t). Also, for athletes preparing to compete at altitude , it’s necessary to train in those conditions
(live high, train high) to get specific adaptations for performance at altitude itself.
Physiological Effects:  LHTH, if the altitude is sufficient (~2,000–3,000 m), will also stimulate EPO release
and red cell mass increase, similar to LHTL. In fact, many early studies of altitude camps (3–4 weeks at
~2,000 m) showed increases in hemoglobin mass on the order of 4–7% . The key difference is in
training under hypoxia : exercising at altitude is harder . VO₂max acutely drops about 7% per 1000 m
ascent, so at 2,000 m an athlete’s maximal aerobic power is roughly ~85% of sea-level capacity . For
any given running speed, they will operate at a higher percentage of their (reduced) VO₂max. In fact,
“any  given  velocity  must  be  performed  at  a  higher  relative  intensity  at  altitude” .  This  means
workouts have to be slowed down or scaled back to stay in the correct training zones. If one tries to hit
sea-level times at altitude, they will likely accumulate excess fatigue or have to cut the workout short.
LHTH protocols therefore inherently involve compromised training intensities  – athletes might do the
same workouts (same distances or durations) but at slower paces, or with longer rest, or they might do
fewer repetitions to avoid excessive fatigue. While the physiological adaptations (RBC, muscle) still
occur ,  the  concern  is  that  the  athlete’s  performance-specific  fitness  might  stagnate  or  decline
because they spend several weeks never reaching their usual speed or power in training. Indeed, some
studies have found that sea-level performance improvements are smaller with LHTH than with LHTL,
even though hemoglobin gains were similar . The difference was attributed to the detraining
effect or lower quality of training at altitude.
That said, LHTH is not without success stories . Many elite Kenyan and Ethiopian runners essentially
follow a LHTH lifestyle by living and training in highland regions (2,000–2,500 m) year-round, and they
clearly have excellent endurance performance. However , it’s arguable that those athletes have fully
adapted by being born and raised at altitude, and they often do some competitions or training blocks at
lower elevations too. For athletes who are not lifetime highlanders, going to do LHTH camps can still
yield benefits, but careful planning is needed to mitigate training loss. Some research (including a
recent meta-analysis in 2025) suggests that  LHTH interventions longer than 3 weeks can improve
aerobic capacity , and in that meta-analysis LHTH showed effectiveness in improving maximal power
output  in elite athletes . This may be because training in hypoxia forces certain adaptations (like45

improved buffering capacity or mental toughness) and once the athlete returns to sea level with full
oxygen, they might realize gains in their maximal efforts. Additionally, for events that will be contested
at altitude (e.g., mountain races or the Olympics if at altitude), LHTH is necessary to acclimate – LHTL
won’t prepare an athlete to actually perform in thin air , since they’d be doing key training at low altitude
conditions.
Practical Challenges:  The downsides of LHTH revolve around managing  lower training paces and
slower recovery . An athlete at 2,500 m might find their easy runs are 20–30 seconds per kilometer
slower than at sea level, and their interval times significantly off their personal bests. This can be
psychologically tough – some feel “out of shape” when in fact it’s the altitude effect. Coaches must
adjust the training plan: for example, interval workouts might be done at reduced speeds (or target
heart rate zones rather than pace) to ensure the effort is appropriate. Alternatively, as one adaptation
strategy, the number of intervals can be broken into shorter reps so that the altitude impact is less
pronounced (short repeats with more rest, as described in the next section on training adjustments).
Even so,  training stress at altitude is higher for a given workload , so athletes may accumulate
fatigue quickly. Recovery between hard sessions often needs to be extended (if you normally do two
intense workouts 48 hours apart at sea level, you might need 72 hours at altitude early on). There is
also greater risk of overtraining or illness if one isn’t careful, since altitude can suppress appetite and
strain the immune system (we’ll address these factors shortly). Another consideration: if an athlete
becomes sick or overly fatigued at altitude, there is little benefit to staying up high – it may negate the
camp’s purpose. Thus, some coaches opt for a hybrid: start with LHTH, and if the athlete struggles,
switch to modified LHTL (e.g., bring them down for a couple of days or for key sessions).
When to Use LHTH:  Despite the challenges, LHTH remains a widely used approach, especially when
logistical constraints prevent LHTL. Many altitude training camps by default are LHTH – e.g., a team
goes to altitude and doesn’t have facilities to train low every day. LHTH can be quite effective for well-
trained athletes who tolerate altitude, as long as training is adjusted intelligently. It may also confer
some unique adaptations: some evidence suggests endurance athletes might see improvements in
skeletal muscle buffering and sprint ability from the stress of repeated hypoxic training bouts (some
coaches claim altitude training helps even for middle-distance events like 800 m due to these effects).
The key is that any performance gains from LHTH must come without too much sacrifice in training
quality.  Notably,  the  meta-analysis  mentioned  earlier  indicated  that  LHTH  combined  with  longer
duration (>3 weeks)  had the best outcomes on aerobic capacity . Longer stays let the athlete
adapt more fully so they can resume near-normal training intensity even while still at altitude (e.g., after
3-4  weeks,  some  acclimatization  allows  slightly  faster  paces  and  better  recovery).  Elite  athletes
sometimes stay 6–8 weeks at altitude, with the latter half of that block effectively training closer to
normal as their body adjusts.
Summary of LHTL vs LHTH:  Both methods aim to increase red blood cells and endurance capacity
through altitude exposure, but  LHTL generally yields superior performance improvements at sea
level  because it permits high-quality training intensities . LHTH is easier logistically (no commute
or  special  equipment)  and  ensures  continuous  hypoxic  stimulus,  but  athletes  must  accept  slower
training paces and potentially extended recovery needs. For coaches and athletes whose primary goal is
sea-level  competition,  LHTL  (if  accessible)  is  usually  recommended  as  the  “gold  standard”  altitude
strategy . Those who cannot do LHTL can still benefit from LHTH camps; they just must be cautious
to adjust training loads. In practice, many combine elements: e.g., live high and do mostly high training,
but perhaps drive to a slightly lower elevation once a week for a key speed workout (a partial LHTL).
Some also use intermittent hypoxic training  (short exposures to hypoxia during workouts or resting)
as adjuncts, though evidence for those is mixed.1248

Quick Comparison – Pros & Cons:
LHTL Pros:  Maximizes RBC gains while maintaining training intensity; better for sea-level race
performance; can be simulated with altitude tents. Cons:  Requires travel or altitude simulation;
less specific if competing at altitude; logistical complexity.
LHTH  Pros:  Constant  altitude  stimulus;  simpler  to  implement  (just  go  to  camp  and  stay);
necessary  for  altitude  race  prep;  can  improve  mental  toughness  and  perhaps  anaerobic
qualities.  Cons:  Training pace and quality reduced; risk of detraining or incomplete workouts;
slower recovery; psychological challenge of feeling “slower” at altitude.
Both methods require meticulous planning of training and recovery, as well as attention to the athlete’s
well-being  under  hypoxic  stress.  Next,  we  will  discuss  those  altitude-specific  challenges  –  sleep,
metabolism, recovery – and how to manage them to get the most out of any altitude training regimen.
Altitude Challenges: Sleep, Metabolic Rate, and Recovery
Training or living at altitude imposes additional stress on the body beyond just the training itself. Many
athletes experience disruptions and challenges when first ascending to high elevations. Key among
these are  poor sleep quality ,  increased basal metabolic rate (BMR)  (with accompanying nutrition
issues), and slower recovery  from exercise. Understanding and managing these factors is crucial for a
successful altitude camp, especially for those who are not accustomed to high elevations. We will
examine each of these challenges in turn, highlighting the physiological causes and offering practical
tips to mitigate their impact.
Sleep Quality at Altitude
It is very common for athletes (and anyone traveling to altitude) to report that their  sleep suffers
initially. The first few nights at high altitude often bring restless sleep, frequent awakenings, and a
subjective  feeling  of  not  being  well-rested  in  the  morning .  There  are  several  physiological
reasons for this:
Nocturnal  Hypoxemia  and  Periodic  Breathing:  During  sleep  at  altitude,  breathing  is  not
regulated  as  tightly  by  conscious  control,  and  the  reduced  oxygen  can  lead  to  episodes  of
periodic breathing . This is a cycle where the sleeper alternates between deep rapid breaths and
shallow breaths or even short  central apneas  (stops in breathing) repeatedly. Essentially, as
blood O₂ drops, you subconsciously hyperventilate for a while, then CO₂ drops and the drive to
breathe reduces, causing an apnea, then the cycle restarts. This pattern is almost universally
seen in newcomers sleeping above ~2,500–3,000 m . The result is fragmented sleep : the
person may not fully wake each cycle, but they drift into lighter sleep stages or awaken briefly
with  a  sensation  of  gasping.  Polysomnography  studies  show  that  high  altitude  sleep  is
characterized by more light sleep (Stage 1)  and less deep sleep (slow-wave) and REM sleep ,
due to these frequent arousals . Oxygen saturation can drop significantly at night – for
instance, one study at 2,900 m noted average nocturnal O₂ saturation in the mid-80% range on
the first night (versus ~95-97% at sea level) . Such low saturation contributes to fitful
sleep.  Although  these  breathing  disturbances  tend  to  improve  over  a  few  days  as  one
acclimatizes, they do not always disappear entirely even after a week or more . Long-term
high-altitude residents do adapt and have far fewer apneas than new arrivals, indicating the
body can adjust its respiratory control over time . But in the short term of an altitude camp,
one should expect some sleep disruption.•

Altitude Sickness Symptoms:  If an athlete suffers from acute mountain sickness (AMS)  in the
first day or two, symptoms like headache, nausea, and dizziness can also interfere with sleep.
Even  mild  AMS  often  includes  poor  sleep  as  a  symptom  on  the  Lake  Louise  score  (a
questionnaire for AMS) . Waking up with a headache or slight nausea is not uncommon the
first morning above ~2,500–3,000 m. These symptoms usually subside after 48–72 hours as
acclimatization progresses, but they can ruin the first couple nights of rest.
Environmental Factors:  High altitudes often have low humidity  and colder nights. The dry air
can cause nasal congestion or dryness, leading to mouth breathing which might worsen snoring
or throat dryness at night. Cold temperatures (if not well heated and insulated) can also disturb
sleep or require thick bedding that might be uncomfortable. Additionally, if athletes are at a busy
training center , new surroundings or noise can affect sleep (though not altitude-specific, it’s part
of being away at camp).
Effects on Performance and Recovery:  Poor sleep quality at altitude can have immediate negative
impacts. Athletes may feel more fatigued during the day, have reduced cognitive function or mood (due
to  lack  of  deep  sleep  and  frequent  oxygen  desaturations  at  night),  and  this  can  reduce  training
performance  and  the  capacity  to  recover .  One  study  pointed  out  that  impaired  sleep  quality
correlates with acute mountain sickness severity and daytime fatigue . Inadequate sleep
also means less muscle repair and hormonal recovery processes overnight – compounding the stress of
training.
Acclimatization Helps:  The good news is that after a few days to a week, sleep tends to improve.
Research shows that by night 5 or 6 at altitude, the incidence of periodic breathing usually diminishes
and blood oxygen at night rises closer to normal as ventilation stabilizes . In the earlier cited
study at 2,900 m, the subjective sleep quality ratings improved from ~39% (very poor) on the first night
to ~55% by the sixth night as acclimatization occurred . Acclimatization reduces the frequency of
apnea events (oxygen dips per hour dropped by more than half over a few days in that study) .
However , even after acclimatization, sleep may not be as sound as at sea level – some degree of periodic
breathing can persist throughout a 2–3 week camp. Moreover , if one returns to altitude repeatedly (e.g.,
a second trip after a break), some adaptation “memory” may carry over to improve sleep slightly on re-
ascent, but generally each new exposure can bring some sleep disturbance .
Tips to Improve Sleep at Altitude:  Coaches and athletes can employ several strategies to mitigate
sleep  issues:  -  Allow  Time:  If  possible,  schedule  an  easier  training  load  in  the  first  ~2  days  after
ascending to altitude. This gives the athlete a chance to recover from travel and poor sleep, and let their
body start acclimating before hard workouts begin. It might even help to arrive at altitude at least 5–7
days before any key intense training sessions, so that sleep and overall comfort have improved. -
Hydration and Diet:  Being well-hydrated can help with dry air issues (preventing excessive drying of
airways). Using saline nasal sprays or a humidifier in bedrooms can alleviate congestion. Also, avoiding
alcohol and heavy meals right before bed is wise – altitude can slow digestion and alcohol worsens
sleep breathing. - Sleep Environment:  Ensure the sleeping quarters are warm enough and bedding is
comfortable. Earplugs and eye masks can help if the environment has noise/light. If using an altitude
tent at home, make sure it’s properly ventilated (some find the tent’s air unit noisy; using white noise
machines can mask that). -  Pharmacological Aids:  Some pharmacological interventions have been
shown effective. Low-dose  acetazolamide  (a mild diuretic/carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) taken before
bed can reduce periodic breathing and improve oxygenation – it essentially causes a slight metabolic
acidosis that drives ventilation, preventing big swings in breathing . It’s often used to prevent AMS
as well. Athletes need to be cautious and typically use it only in consultation with a physician, as it is a
medication (and it causes more frequent urination, so plan for bathroom breaks). Another aid is a mild
sleeping  pill  –  studies  have  found  that  a  short-acting  sedative  like  zolpidem  or  temazepam  can•

improve sleep quality at altitude without causing respiratory depression, especially if periodic breathing
is the main issue . These should be used with care (and are generally permitted in competition, but
one should check doping regulations for any restrictions). Natural supplements like melatonin could
also be considered; melatonin might help adjust the body clock if traveling across time zones to an
altitude camp, though its efficacy specifically for altitude sleep isn’t clearly proven. - “Arrival Timing”
Approach:  Interestingly,  one  approach  some  adopt  (for  competitions  at  altitude )  is  to  arrive
immediately before competition to essentially “race before sleep is severely impacted.” For example,
some athletes racing at a moderate altitude will arrive the evening before – in the first ~12–24 hours,
the body’s responses (like EPO, breathing instability) haven’t fully kicked in, and one might get through
the race with sea-level physiology intact . However , for training camps where you intend to stay,
this isn’t applicable; it’s more a race strategy.
For athletes using altitude training for sea-level gains, the bottom line is: plan for suboptimal sleep
initially and allocate extra time for rest.  One coaching recommendation is simply to  spend more
time in bed  at altitude – if you normally sleep 8 hours, try to be in bed for 9-10 hours to get the same
amount of quality sleep, since some of that time will be lighter sleep or awake . Prioritize good sleep
hygiene and listen to your body; if fatigue accumulates due to poor sleep, consider an afternoon nap or
an extra recovery day.
Basal Metabolic Rate and Nutrition at Altitude
Living at altitude doesn’t just affect oxygen delivery – it also alters your metabolism and appetite. A well-
documented  effect  of  acute  altitude  exposure  is  an  increase  in  basal  metabolic  rate  (BMR) .
Essentially,  your  body  burns  more  calories  at  rest  when  you’re  at  high  altitude  than  at  sea  level.
Simultaneously, many people experience a  suppression of appetite  in the first days at altitude. This
combination can be problematic for athletes because it can lead to unintended weight loss (including
loss of muscle mass) or insufficient energy for training.
BMR Increases:  Research indicates that acute hypoxia boosts the body’s resting energy expenditure.
For example, exposure to a high altitude of about 4,300 m was found to raise BMR by ~25–27% in the
first few days compared to sea-level measurements . Even after 2–3 weeks at that altitude, BMR
remained roughly 17% above sea-level baseline  in subjects who maintained adequate food intake
. In a classic study, Butterfield et al. (1992) showed that at 4,300 m, if caloric intake was sufficient to
prevent weight loss, resting metabolic rate stayed ~17% elevated through three weeks . The
increase  in  metabolism  is  attributed  to  several  factors:  the  increased  work  of  breathing  (you’re
ventilating  more  liters  of  air  per  minute,  which  uses  more  energy),  heightened  activity  of  the
sympathetic  nervous  system  (releasing  catecholamines  that  raise  metabolic  rate),  and  possibly
inefficiencies  as  the  body  deals  with  hypoxia  (e.g.,  the  heart  is  beating  faster  even  at  rest).  Cold
exposure at altitude could also contribute if not in a climate-controlled environment.
For moderate training altitudes (e.g., 1,800–2,500 m), the BMR bump may be less dramatic than at 4,300
m but can still be on the order of ~5–10% initially, tapering to a slightly higher-than-normal level after
acclimation. Even a 5–10% rise means an athlete burning, say, 2,500 kcal/day at rest might burn 2,750
kcal/day – a difference that can quickly create a deficit if not addressed by eating more.
Appetite and Weight Changes:  Paradoxically, even as the body burns more energy, altitude often
blunts hunger . Many athletes notice they feel full faster and have less desire to eat in the first week at
altitude. This altitude anorexia is well documented: hormonal changes like increased leptin (an appetite-
suppressing  hormone)  and  reduced  ghrelin  (hunger  hormone)  have  been  observed  in  hypoxic
environments . There’s also a psychological aspect – some people just find food less palatable at
altitude, possibly due to mild nausea or altered taste/smell perceptions. One comprehensive review62

---PAGE---

noted reduced appetite and changes in taste  as common at high altitudes, contributing to difficulty
in meeting energy needs .
If caloric intake does not meet the increased demands, weight loss will occur . Initially, some weight loss
at altitude is water loss (from increased respiration and diuresis). But extended calorie deficit will lead to
loss of fat and muscle. In fact, in extreme altitudes (>5,000 m) significant muscle wasting is a known
issue. At training camp altitudes (~2,000–3,000 m), the goal is to avoid  significant weight loss, since the
aim is performance gain, not weight loss (unless an individual specifically wants to reduce weight, but
even then, losing weight too quickly can impair training). 
Practical Strategies:  To ensure that the metabolic boost works for you (improved fitness) and not
against you (excess fatigue or muscle loss), consider the following: - Increase Caloric Intake:  Athletes
should consciously eat more when at altitude. Even if appetite is low, plan for additional snacks or larger
portions of carbohydrate-rich foods which are easier to eat in volume. Carbohydrates are also the
body’s preferred fuel at altitude – interestingly, metabolism shifts such that a greater proportion of
energy comes from carbs versus fat at altitude, since carbs yield more energy per oxygen unit. In line
with this, many people intuitively crave more carbs at altitude (after the initial appetite suppression
phase). Coaches can encourage athletes to target perhaps 300–600 extra calories per day  initially and
adjust based on weight stability. Monitoring body weight every few days can be useful; a sudden drop
of more than 1–2 lbs in the first week could indicate insufficient intake. - High-Carb, Nutrient-Dense
Foods:  Since appetite might be down, make every bite count. Nutrient-dense foods like nuts, dried
fruits, energy bars, or sports drinks can help pack calories without requiring huge volume. Emphasize
carbohydrates around training (to fuel workouts and recovery) and adequate protein (to support muscle
repair). Some athletes find liquid nutrition (smoothies, recovery shakes) useful if they struggle to eat
enough solids. - Iron and Micronutrients:  Higher metabolism and increased red blood cell synthesis
both mean nutrient demands are up . Iron is especially crucial (we discuss iron more below, but as part
of nutrition: ensure iron intake is sufficient through diet or supplements, because altitude-induced
erythropoiesis can deplete iron stores). Also, antioxidant vitamins (C, E) and others might help mitigate
oxidative  stress  from  hypoxia.  However ,  be  cautious  with  extreme  antioxidant  supplementation,  as
some oxidative stress is part of the training adaptation signal; a normal balanced diet with fruits and
vegetables is usually sufficient. - Maintain Hydration:  Though not “metabolism” per se, hydration ties
closely to metabolic function. At altitude you lose more fluid through breathing (every exhalation is
moist and altitude air is dry) and often through increased urination in early days (high altitude diuresis).
Dehydration  can  suppress  appetite  further  and  reduce  performance.  Athletes  should  aim  to  drink
regularly, even beyond thirst. Including electrolyte beverages can help, as plain water in excess can
occasionally lead to electrolyte dilution. A simple guideline is checking urine color (straw-colored is
good;  dark  yellow  indicates  dehydration).  Many  coaches  advise  carrying  a  bottle  and  sipping
throughout the day, targeting perhaps an extra 1–1.5 liters of fluid per day compared to sea level needs
.
Metabolic  Adjustments  Over  Time:  Typically,  after  about  a  week  or  two,  the  body’s  hormonal
responses adjust. BMR may slightly come down from the initial spike as the most energy-intensive
acclimation processes (like ramped up ventilation and heart rate) become efficient. Appetite usually
returns or even overshoots (some athletes get very hungry after a week or two, as if the body is trying
to catch up). A classic military study noted that if energy intake is maintained, BMR stays ~15–17%
higher chronically; if intake is not maintained and weight is lost, BMR tends to drop back toward normal
after  the  weight  loss  (since  there’s  less  body  mass  to  feed) .  The  key  point  is  to  prevent
significant negative energy balance  during the critical adaptation period. If an athlete comes down
from  altitude  in  a  significantly  glycogen-depleted  or  muscle-depleted  state,  they  won’t  perform
optimally despite the RBC gains.72

In summary, altitude will speed up your body’s engine  – plan to put more fuel in it. Coaches should
emphasize nutrition as much as training during altitude camps: schedule group meals, track athletes’
weight and well-being, and possibly involve a sports nutritionist to help with meal planning at altitude.
Recovery and Fatigue Management at Altitude
Altitude not only impacts how you train  but also how you recover . Many athletes find that they do not
bounce back from hard workouts as quickly at altitude as they do at sea level. There are a few reasons
for this: - Lower oxygen availability means that after a hard effort, the muscles receive less oxygen for
the restoration processes (e.g., clearing lactate, resynthesizing phosphocreatine, repairing fibers) in the
hours post-exercise. Mitochondria rely on oxygen to produce ATP for recovery; at altitude this process is
slower , especially before full acclimation. - Altitude itself is a stressor – the body is working overtime on
acclimating (producing RBCs, increasing ventilation, etc.), which consumes energy and resources that
could otherwise go into recovery from training. Essentially, your body has “two jobs”: adapting to
altitude and adapting to training, simultaneously. - As discussed, sleep may be impaired and basal
metabolism is elevated, both of which can compound fatigue and delay recovery.
Evidence  of  Slower  Recovery:  A  study  on  muscle  oxygenation  found  that  after  exercise,  the
reoxygenation  of  muscle  tissue  was  significantly  slower  under  hypoxic  conditions  than  in
normoxia . Practically, athletes notice that their legs feel heavy for longer , muscle soreness might
linger  an  extra  day,  and  heart  rate  variability  (if  monitored)  remains  depressed  longer  after  hard
sessions at altitude. The Wikipedia entry on altitude training explicitly mentions that “Altitude training
can produce slow recovery  due to the stress of hypoxia” . 
Also, markers of muscle damage or effort (like blood lactate and heart rate) can be higher for a given
workout at altitude, meaning the workout exacts a greater toll. For example, an interval session that
would only mildly tax an athlete at sea level could drive them into a much higher lactate zone at altitude
because of the reduced O₂ – this can result in greater muscle glycogen depletion and metabolic stress
to recover from .
Heart Rate and Recovery:  An interesting observation coaches often make is that resting heart rate  is
elevated at altitude (especially in the first week or so). It’s not uncommon to see resting HR 5–15 beats
per minute higher than usual upon waking. Additionally,  heart rate variability (HRV) , a measure of
autonomic  nervous  system  recovery,  tends  to  decrease  at  altitude  initially  (reflecting  increased
sympathetic stress). Over time, resting HR may come down a bit with acclimation, but it can remain a bit
higher than sea level. Some coaches use these metrics to modulate training – if an athlete’s resting HR
is still very high or HRV very low, they might hold off on another intense session.
Practical Recovery Strategies:  Given the above, athletes should adjust their recovery protocols at
altitude: - Extended Recovery Between Hard Efforts:  It is often recommended to allow a bit more time
between intense workouts. If at sea level an athlete might do hard interval sessions on Monday and
Thursday, at altitude they might shift to Monday and Friday (an extra day) in the first week or two. Or
they keep the schedule but make the Wednesday (mid-week) day extremely light (perhaps even lighter
than usual). - Active Recovery and Oxygen:  Some athletes use supplemental oxygen during recovery
periods to speed up recovery (for instance, breathing from an oxygen tank for a few minutes after a
hard interval, a technique seen in some elite camps). The science on this is mixed, but theoretically
giving the body a burst of O₂ might help clear metabolites faster . In general, low-intensity “flush”
workouts (easy cycling or light jogging) can help promote circulation, but one must keep them truly
easy as even easy work is harder at altitude. - Hydration and Massage:  Being well-hydrated improves
circulation  and  muscle  repair .  As  mentioned,  dehydration  is  common  at  altitude  and  can  impede
recovery by reducing blood plasma volume. Regular sports massage or using foam rollers can aid76

muscle recovery – this isn’t altitude-specific, but with possibly heightened muscle soreness at altitude,
these tools are valuable. -  Antioxidants:  Altitude causes increased oxidative stress (because hypoxia
and  re-oxygenation  cycles  can  create  free  radicals).  Some  athletes  supplement  with  antioxidants
(vitamin C, E, etc.) to support recovery, though as always not to excessive levels that might blunt
adaptation. Tart cherry juice or other polyphenol-rich foods could be beneficial to include for their
recovery properties.
Listening to the Body:  Perhaps the most important point is that athletes and coaches should be
flexible with training plans at altitude. If the program called for 5 sets of a workout but the athlete is
clearly struggling after 3–4 due to the altitude strain, it’s wise to cut it short and avoid a deep state of
fatigue that could take days to come back from. Similarly, if morning resting HR is very high or the
athlete reports feeling unusually fatigued, an easy day or rest day can save the overall camp from
derailing. It’s better to under-do a little than to overdo and require several days off.
The  SimpliFaster altitude guide  emphasizes that because of increased stress and reduced oxygen,
“the reduced ability to recover from hard efforts”  is notable at altitude, especially before adaptations
have occurred . They advise that athletes must run slower on easy days to allow proper recovery, and
generally reduce training load initially to accommodate the body’s added stress . This might mean
more Zone 1–2 work relative to normal. Runners often switch to measuring easy runs by  duration
rather than distance  at altitude – e.g., instead of aiming for 10 miles, they’ll run for the equivalent time
it would take at sea level. If 10 miles at sea level takes 65 minutes, at altitude they might still run 65
minutes but cover only ~9 miles, and accept that as sufficient . This removes the mental pressure
to “hit a mileage” that could push them into excessive effort.
Altitude Sickness and Recovery:  We should note that if an athlete experiences moderate AMS (e.g.,
headaches, poor sleep, low appetite), their recovery will be further impaired. It’s crucial to prevent AMS
by ascending gradually if possible (for instance, instead of going straight to 2500 m, spend a night at
1500–2000 m on the way up). If an athlete does get AMS symptoms, slowing down training and focusing
on rest until they acclimatize is key. In severe cases, descending to a lower altitude for a day or two can
help them recover and then retry going up.
In summary, recovering at altitude demands extra care . Athletes should sleep more , rest more , and
embrace easier training intensities to allow their bodies to adapt. With time (usually by the second week
of an altitude camp), many athletes find a new groove where recovery begins to normalize as they
acclimate. By the end of a multi-week camp, some even report feeling great as the hardest adjustment
period is over and fitness has improved. The goal is to reach that point without having broken down
along the way, which is why monitoring recovery is so crucial.
Adjusting Training Intensity: Heart Rate and Pace Zones at
Altitude
One of the most practical challenges for athletes training at altitude is how to adjust their training paces
and effort zones. Because altitude impairs performance capacity, the paces corresponding to various
intensity zones (easy, threshold, interval, etc.) will be slower than at sea level. Similarly, heart rate
responses can differ in the thin air . Properly adjusting expectations and using the right tools to gauge
intensity is critical; otherwise, athletes risk either overtraining by chasing sea-level paces or under-
training by being too cautious. In this section, we outline how to recalibrate pace and heart rate zones
for altitude training.78

Pace Adjustments and “Effort-Based” Training
Expect Slower Paces:  A simple fact: at altitude you  will run slower  for the same effort. How much
slower depends on altitude and the individual, but even at a relatively mild altitude like 1,500 m (~5,000
ft), an endurance runner might see 3–5% slower times for the same exertion. At 2,500 m, the slowdown
might be on the order of 6–10%. For example, if your sea-level easy run pace is 5:00 per km, at 2,500 m
it might be closer to 5:20–5:30 per km for the same easy effort. This is a normal consequence of
reduced VO₂max and increased energy cost of running in hypoxia . Coaches often have rules of
thumb (Jack Daniels, for instance, produced charts of race time adjustments: a 5K at 1800 m might be
~20 seconds slower than at sea level, etc., which translates roughly to training paces). The  German
Journal of Sports Medicine  article quantified that time trial performance drops ~6.5–7% per 1000 m
acutely , so training paces should be adjusted accordingly.
Use Perceived Effort or Time:  One effective method is to train by effort (RPE) or by time instead of
distance . The SimpliFaster guide suggests that instead of prescribing a certain pace or distance for
runs at altitude, prescribe the  duration  that the workout would normally take at sea level . For
instance, rather than 10 miles at 6:30/mile (~65 minutes) which the athlete might not achieve at altitude,
just run 65 minutes at a steady effort . You’ll cover less distance, but you’ll have put in the same
aerobic stimulus without the psychological stress of “missing the pace.” For hard efforts like tempo
runs, they advise running for the same time  at tempo effort as you would for a given distance at sea
level . This approach ensures the athlete trains the correct energy system (threshold, etc.) without
overexerting to hit an arbitrary pace.
If coaches prefer more concrete adjustments, some approximate pace corrections: - At 1,500 m (5,000
ft): add ~3–4% to interval paces (e.g., a 4:00 min/km interval pace at sea level might be ~4:08–4:10 min/
km at altitude). - At 2,000 m (6,600 ft): add ~5–6%. - At 2,500 m (8,200 ft): add ~8–10%. These are broad
estimates  and  individual  variability  is  high.  Athletes  should  learn  to  listen  to  their  breathing  and
muscular cues. If a pace that should feel “moderately hard” feels “extremely hard” at altitude, they need
to back off, regardless of what the watch says.
Interval Training Modifications:  For structured interval workouts, there are a few strategies to adapt
them, as highlighted by SimpliFaster and other coaches : 1. Slower Pace, Same Volume:  Do the
same workout volume and rest as at sea level, but accept slower repetition times (e.g., 6×1000 m
repeats that you normally do in 3:00, might be 3:10–3:15 at 7,500 ft) . This keeps the aerobic stimulus
similar , though the neuromuscular aspect of running at race pace is sacrificed. To counter that, some
workouts near sea-level pace should be included later (see strategy 2 or 3). 2. Same Pace, Longer Rest:
Keep your target sea-level pace for intervals, but extend the recovery periods to allow full recovery at
altitude . For instance, if you want to run 1k repeats in 3:00 as usual, you might rest 3:30 instead of
2:00 between reps. This ensures you hit the neuromuscular and VO₂max paces, but note it changes the
workout physiology (more of a speed session with more rest). It can be useful sparingly, but if you
overextend rest for every workout, you might not get the desired endurance adaptations. 3. Break into
Shorter Reps (Alt. Pace Simulation):  Another trick is to split intervals into shorter segments with short
rests, simulating the same total work but never letting the body get as oxygen-starved. For example,
instead of 6×1600 m at 5:00 with 2:30 rest (sea-level workout), you could do sets of 400 m repeats : 6
sets of 4×400 m at 75s (which is 5:00/mile pace) with 60s rest between 400s and 2:30 between sets .
This way, you run the same total distance at sea-level speed, but each rep is short enough that altitude’s
effect is less limiting, and you get brief recoveries to recharge. This approach allows the athlete to
experience sea-level race cadence and form (neuromuscular benefit) while still accumulating volume.
It’s a bit more complex to execute but highly effective – essentially a form of “interval within interval”
training.46

---PAGE---

Most coaches will use a mix of these methods. For longer intervals or tempo runs, option 1 (just slower
pace) is common early in the camp. As the athlete acclimates, they might incorporate some option 2 or
3 workouts to reintroduce race pace.
Don’t Chase Sea-Level Splits:  The overarching advice is do not stubbornly chase your sea-level splits at
altitude , as it can lead to exhaustion or loss of confidence. As the COROS coaching article puts it: “Instead
of chasing splits, use heart rate zones... Pace zones won’t shift immediately [to altitude] and trying to match
them can lead to overtraining” . We’ll discuss heart rate next, but this quote encapsulates the risk
– many an athlete has ruined an altitude camp by treating every workout as a test to prove they haven’t
lost fitness, rather than adjusting to the reality of altitude.
Heart Rate Zones and Monitoring
Heart Rate Response at Altitude:  Heart rate (HR) is a useful metric at altitude, but it has its nuances.
Initially, resting and submaximal exercise heart rates are elevated at altitude, due to lower oxygen and
higher sympathetic drive . For a given easy run pace, your HR might be 10 bpm higher than normal
in week 1. Over time, as you acclimate (increase stroke volume a bit, reduce stress hormones), your
submax HR for that pace might come down closer to your usual.  Maximal heart rate , interestingly,
often decreases  at altitude – many athletes cannot hit their sea-level max HR when oxygen is limited .
This might be partly protective (the body limiting itself under hypoxia) or due to earlier fatigue. For
example, a runner with a 190 bpm max at sea level might only reach ~180 bpm in an all-out effort at
2500 m. 
So the HR curve shifts: higher at submax, lower at max. What does that mean for training zones? - Your
aerobic zones (Zone 1-2)  might show higher numbers than expected for a given pace initially. But if
you train by HR, you’ll simply be going slower to keep in Zone 2 range. - Your threshold HR  (if defined
as a percentage of max or a certain number) might actually remain similar . Many coaches advise using
heart rate as a reliable guide because, despite the altitude, if you know your threshold is around 170
bpm at sea level, working at that HR at altitude should equate to a similar physiological intensity (even
though the speed will be lower). In other words, 170 bpm still reflects your body working at threshold
effort, just the output is different. - Because max HR is a bit suppressed, the top end of your zones
might compress. But practically, most athletes won’t be training at true max effort frequently.
Using Heart Rate Zones:  The COROS altitude guide suggests that heart rate zones remain accurate
across altitudes  because HR “responds directly to the physiological stress of reduced oxygen” .
It recommends  “trust your HR”  over pace when in doubt . This is good advice for controlling
intensity. For example, if a workout is meant to be at 85% HRmax (typical tempo effort), the athlete can
aim for that HR regardless of the pace – thus ensuring they are stressing the body appropriately
without overdoing it. 
However , one must account for the initial changes in HR: in the first days, dehydration or anxiety might
spike HR abnormally. It’s wise to wait a couple of days before strictly adhering to HR, or at least
understand it might read high at first. Also, if an athlete normally uses HR-based training load metrics
(like TRIMP or training stress scores), they should note that their Training Load might appear higher
at altitude  for equivalent sessions, because the HR is higher . This is not necessarily a bad thing
– it reflects the body working harder . In fact, some wearables have an “altitude acclimation” feature that
monitors if your HR at rest is lowering over time at altitude, indicating adaptation .
Adjusting  Zones:  If  an  athlete  has  very  dialed-in  pace  zones  from  sea-level  testing,  they  should
essentially toss those out at altitude and either use HR zones or perceived effort. One could also do a
short field test at altitude once acclimated (for example, a 20-minute time trial to gauge new threshold8788

pace and HR at altitude) and derive temporary zones from that. But since altitude camps are usually
temporary, many prefer not to re-calibrate everything formally; instead, they just use more subjective
control.
Example:  Suppose a runner’s sea-level threshold pace is 4:00/km and threshold HR ~170. At 2,000 m,
they might find that running 4:15/km gets their HR to 170. If they tried 4:00/km, HR might climb to 180+
(which would be supra-threshold for them). So they should do threshold runs at ~4:15 pace to stay
around 170 HR. Over a few sessions, they’ll know that “4:15 is my new tempo pace up here.” If they
return again to altitude, they can recall these adjustments as a starting point (though fitness changes
year to year , so always adjust if needed).
Altitude and Races:  If an athlete is training for a race at altitude , pacing strategy must accommodate
the reduced capacity. E.g., a marathon at 1800 m will be several minutes slower than at sea level for the
same fitness. Training in that environment helps calibrate the feel. But since our focus is sea-level
performance, we mainly emphasize altitude as a training stimulus rather than a race environment.
Monitoring Recovery with HR:  As touched on earlier , HR can also guide recovery. If an athlete’s resting
HR is elevated by, say, >5–7 bpm compared to their acclimated normal, it could indicate incomplete
recovery or lingering fatigue. Heart rate variability (HRV)  monitors are also popular . Typically, expect a
sharp  drop  in  HRV  on  first  arriving  at  altitude  (indicating  stress),  and  a  gradual  rebound  as
acclimatization occurs. Athletes who maintain or regain good HRV scores (or low resting HR) after a
week are likely coping well and can handle increased training loads.
Other Training Zone Considerations
Ventilation and “Breathing Zone”:  Some coaches use breathing rate or talk test for easy runs. At
altitude, you’ll start breathing harder at lower intensities. An easy run might feel like you’re breathing as
hard as a moderate run at sea level. That’s normal. The talk test (can you speak full sentences?) still
works  –  if  you’re  gasping  where  you  normally  wouldn’t,  slow  down.  Don’t  be  alarmed  that  you’re
breathing a lot even on easy runs; that’s just the ventilatory response to hypoxia.
Perceived  Exertion  (RPE):  Ultimately,  RPE  is  a  reliable  gauge  when  an  athlete  is  honest  with
themselves. At altitude, athletes need to internalize that  “easy means easy”  – if it feels like you’re
pushing, then for an easy day it’s too fast. Conversely, a true hard effort will  feel extremely taxing at
altitude (legs burning, lungs burning). Using the classic Borg scale or a 1–10 effort scale, athletes should
aim to match the intended RPE of a workout rather than the speed. Coaches can educate athletes
beforehand:  “Expect your 5K race pace effort to be 10-15 sec/km slower here. Focus on the effort, not the
watch.”
Training Zones Summary:  - Use Heart Rate and RPE  as primary guides for intensity at altitude. They
ensure you’re in the right physiological zone. - Adjust pace targets down . It’s better to err on the side
of slightly too slow than too fast initially. - Over the course of the camp, if adaptation occurs and paces
improve at the same HR, that’s a sign of fitness/ acclimation gains. - Communicate : If you’re a coach,
talk to your athletes about how the efforts should feel. Remove any stigma about running slower –
frame it as doing the right thing to get the benefits of altitude. - For group training, athletes should be
cautious not to turn sessions into races because everyone’s adaptation will vary. The group should
agree to train at the appropriate effort, not the front runner’s sea-level pace.

Practical Coaching Tips for Altitude Training
Bringing together all the above information, here is a summary of practical recommendations and
coaching tips for implementing altitude training effectively:
Ensure Sufficient Duration:  Plan altitude camps of at least 3–4 weeks  if the goal is to materially
increase red blood cell mass and see performance gains . Smaller boosts can occur in 2
weeks, but the optimal ratio of benefit to time is around 3–4 weeks of living high. Remember
that RBC gains and performance benefits will taper off after ~2–3 weeks back at sea level, so
schedule key races ideally within ~1–2 weeks of coming down .
Choose the Right Altitude:  Moderate altitudes of ~1,800–2,500 m are generally recommended.
Higher  altitudes  (3,000  m+)  produce  more  EPO,  but  also  more  stress  and  risk  of  illness/
overtraining.  Many  find  ~2,000–2,200  m  to  be  a  “sweet  spot”  for  living  –  high  enough  to
stimulate adaptation, low enough to still feel decent. For training in LHTL, being able to drop to
~1,000 m or lower is ideal . If doing LHTH, consider a slightly lower elevation (e.g., 1,600–
1,800 m) so that training isn’t as severely impacted; some studies indicated that athletes living
and  training  around  2100–2500  m  had  improvements,  whereas  those  who  tried  >2800  m
struggled . Individualize:  If an athlete has never been to altitude, a conservative altitude
(e.g., 6,000 ft) is a good starting point to see how they respond .
Iron Stores and Supplementation: Check iron status (ferritin levels)  before altitude training.
Endurance athletes, especially females, are often borderline low on iron. Since EPO-driven RBC
production consumes a lot of iron, starting an altitude camp with low ferritin can result in an
inadequate  response  (the  body  can’t  make  new  RBCs  effectively) .  It’s  commonly
recommended to supplement with iron for several weeks before  and during the altitude stay
. Typical advice: 65 mg of elemental iron (e.g., ferrous sulfate) daily on an empty stomach
with vitamin C to aid absorption, starting ~2-3 weeks pre-ascent. Continue through the camp.
Use liquid iron if tolerable (higher absorption) . Monitor ferritin if the camp is long. Adequate
dietary iron (red meat, leafy greens, beans) should also be emphasized.  Caution:  Don’t over-
supplement to the point of iron overload – work with a medical professional on dosing. The goal
is to be in a healthy ferritin range (~50–100 ng/mL) when at altitude.
Hydration and Environmental Prep:  At altitude,  drink more fluids  than you think you need.
Carry water and sip frequently . Also, be prepared for large temperature swings – days can be
warm under the sun but nights cold.  Dress in layers  when training, as altitude sun can be
intense but you cool quickly in shade or wind . Use sunscreen; UV radiation is stronger at
altitude. All these seem basic, but an ill-prepared athlete who gets sunburned or dehydrated will
have a harder time acclimating.
Ramp Up Training Gradually:  In the first week at altitude, reduce training volume and intensity
compared to a normal week. For example, some coaches cut volume by ~20% in week 1 and
avoid very intense sessions in the first 3–4 days. This gives the athlete’s body a chance to
acclimate (EPO is surging, fluid shifts are happening). After about 5-7 days, if the athlete is
handling it, training load can begin to increase toward normal.  Avoid high-intensity interval
training in the first few days ; instead, do light aerobic and perhaps some short strides. Once
the initial AMS risk period is over and the athlete’s resting vitals stabilize, then introduce harder
workouts.•

Monitor Health and Well-being:  Stay vigilant for signs of  excess fatigue, illness, or AMS .
Common red flags: persistent headache, loss of appetite, poor sleep, undue breathlessness or
racing heart at rest, dizziness, or extreme lethargy. If an athlete experiences these, don’t push
through  –  back  off  training,  ensure  hydration  and  nutrition,  consider  descending  a  bit  if
symptoms are moderate/severe. Altitude sickness can usually be managed by rest and maybe a
mild analgesic (for headache) and acetazolamide if needed. It typically resolves in 1–3 days with
no hard training. It’s better to lose two days of training than to have an athlete feeling awful for
two weeks.
Leverage Technology (if available):  Devices like pulse oximeters can be used each morning to
track O₂ saturation – this can be interesting data (e.g., seeing SpO₂ rise from 88% to 92% over a
week as a sign of acclimation). Likewise, tracking resting heart rate and HRV with a wearable can
provide feedback on adaptation. These aren’t strictly necessary, but they can validate how an
athlete is coping. If HRV is continuously low and not rebounding, it may indicate that training
load is too high or recovery is insufficient at altitude.
Psychological  Coaching:  Athletes  might  feel  discouraged  when  they  see  slower  times.  It’s
important to set their expectations beforehand: “You will be slower up there, and that’s normal. It
doesn’t  mean  you’re  losing  fitness.”  Emphasize  the  effort-based  success  criteria  for  workouts.
Celebrate  things  like  hitting  the  target  HR  or  power ,  rather  than  the  split.  Keep  the  team
atmosphere positive – if everyone knows to expect the slow down, there’s less angst. Also,
remind them that any struggle at altitude will pay off later: “If you can run 5×1000 m in 3:15 at
7,000 ft today, imagine how much easier your 3:05’s will feel back at sea level with more red blood
cells!”
Descending  and  Peaking:  After  completing  an  altitude  block,  plan  the  return  to  sea  level
strategically. Common practice: Descend about 7–10 days before a major competition  at sea
level. Many athletes report feeling a big boost ~7 days after coming down, once any minor
“rebound” effects settle (the first 1-2 days off altitude, some feel sluggish as plasma volume
normalizes). By a week out, they have high RBC mass plus restored sleep and full oxygen –
perfect for a race. Alternatively, some like to race very soon (1–3 days) after coming down, to
“shock” the system. But beyond ~2–3 weeks after descent, the RBC mass advantage diminishes
as older RBCs die off and EPO returns to low altitude baseline. Plan competitions accordingly to
capitalize on the window of enhanced physiology.
When Not to Do Altitude:  Despite its benefits, altitude training is not a magic bullet and it isn’t
for everyone. If an athlete is inexperienced or prone to anemia, or if the timing before a key
event is too short, it might do more harm than good to squeeze in a hurried altitude stint. Also, if
an athlete is in a heavy competition season, going to altitude (which might initially undercut
performance) mid-season could negatively affect races. Generally, altitude camps are best in
base or early season or as a dedicated build before a targeted event, not randomly in the middle
of a race circuit. 
By  following  these  guidelines,  coaches  can  maximize  the  chance  that  their  athletes  emerge  from
altitude training  fitter, faster, and ready to set personal bests at sea level . Altitude training is a
powerful tool in the endurance coach’s arsenal – when applied with knowledge and care, it can simulate
the  effect  of  “natural  EPO”  legally  and  effectively ,  boost  aerobic  capacity,  and  confer  a
competitive edge.•

Conclusion
Altitude  training,  when  executed  properly,  offers  endurance  runners  and  athletes  a  unique
physiological advantage. The low-oxygen environment triggers an erythropoietin-driven increase in
red blood cells  and hemoglobin mass – nature’s way of enhancing oxygen transport – as well as a host
of other adaptations like improved oxygen unloading (2,3-BPG increase), capillarization, and aerobic
enzyme efficiency. These changes can translate into a noticeable performance improvement at sea
level, often on the order of a few percent which is hugely meaningful in competitive contexts . 
We explored the two main altitude training models: Live High–Train Low , which allows athletes to reap
altitude  benefits  while  maintaining  high  training  quality  (and  is  generally  superior  for  sea-level
performance gains) ; and Live High–Train High , the traditional approach that still builds red blood
cells  but  requires  smart  adjustments  due  to  training  limitations .  Both  can  be  effective  if
managed well, with LHTL being the preferred method for most scenarios where logistics permit.
Athletes and coaches must also navigate the challenges of altitude : the first nights of fitful sleep, the
sudden  spike  in  metabolic  demands  and  potential  weight  loss,  and  the  slower  recovery  between
workouts.  By  anticipating  these  issues  –  prioritizing  sleep,  upping  caloric  intake  (especially
carbohydrates), staying hydrated, and scaling back training load initially – one can prevent altitude from
becoming a setback. As the saying goes in altitude circles, “Train high, don’t strain high .” Patience in
the first days pays off in the later weeks.
When it comes to  training guidance at altitude , the emphasis should be on  intensity control  rather
than hitting specific speeds. Using heart rate and perceived effort as guides ensures the athlete is
training the intended energy system without overreaching . Paces will naturally be slower; that’s
expected and should not be resisted. Coaches can employ creative interval adjustments and time-based
prescriptions to keep training effective and morale high. The outcome of a well-executed altitude camp
is an athlete who arrives at sea level with higher red cell volume, intact speed and fitness (thanks to
intelligent training adjustments), and often a mental boost from having thrived in a tough environment.
For amateur and semi-professional runners, altitude training should be approached with the same rigor
as any advanced training intervention. It’s not only for elites – recreational marathoners, for instance,
might see gains from a hiking trip or few weeks working remotely from the mountains (as long as they
maintain training appropriately). But it’s crucial to implement the principles outlined: get your iron
checked, plan your training load, listen to your body, and don’t panic when you feel winded on an easy
jog up high.
In conclusion, altitude training remains a potent method to “take your endurance to new heights”  –
literally and figuratively. By understanding the physiology (EPO, hemoglobin, etc.) and combining that
knowledge  with  practical  coaching  strategies  (LHTL  vs  LHTH,  adjusting  zones,  recovery  protocols),
athletes  can  safely  harness  hypoxia  to  enhance  their  sea-level  performance.  As  with  any  training
modality, individual responses vary, so monitor and adjust the program to the athlete’s needs. When
done correctly, the athlete will come down from the mountains fitter and faster , ready to capitalize on
their newly augmented aerobic engine.  The mountains will have made them stronger, and the
rewards will be reaped on the roads, tracks, and trails at sea level.
